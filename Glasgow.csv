0,UX/UI Designer,Cathcart Associates,"Glasgow, UK",via My ArkLaMiss Jobs,"An established software house is on the lookout for an experienced UX/UI Designer to join their Glasgow base. Due to their success, they're looking to expand their team and as part of that are looking to enhance the UX/UI Design skills within the team.

The company already work with multi-national clients across many different industries, but their clientele is expanding all the time. Having been around for over 20 years now, they are globally known as the market leaders within their field!

What will I be doing?

Great question!

The company are also looking to re-develop and improve their award-winning platform and are working with a range of modern tech to ensure they stay ahead of their competition within the market!

You'll obviously work very closely with your design team and will report into the Head of Product. They have dedicated research experts, so you'll focus more on the design side of things but will still be expected to appreciate understand the importance of research... as well.

One of the best things about this role and company, is that you'll be working on a product that generally matters. It's a product that improves people's working environments across the world and you will play a massive part in improving the user experience of the product!

Who am I?

Ideally, you'll have experience working as a Digital Product/UX/UI Designer. This role will be key in re-shaping how the product is used by the company's customers so would suit someone that is motivated to make an impact in an already-successful business!

You should be someone that can take findings from research and transform these into attractive designs that are in-line with the research analysis. The company are in the process of building their internal Design System, so any experience of this would be ideal. Experience designing on a SaaS platform would be very beneficial as well.

In terms of personality, the team are super outgoing and collaborative, so they are looking for a similar personality. The team work really closely together, so you'll have a great support network and other passionate Designers to bounce ideas off of. You'll be dealing with different stakeholders so experience of this would be great but it's not essential as they can offer lots of training on how to improve these skills. The main thing that they're looking for is someone that is fanatical about their craft, if this is you then you'll fit right in!

What are the benefits and where will I be based?

This is probably worth knowing before applying. The salary range for the role is 40,000 - 55,000 which is dependent on experience.

The company have an office in Glasgow, but the team pretty much works fully remote. You might be asked to meet up with the team every now and then, but this is by no means essential. If you do prefer to work in an office, then they're more than happy for you to do so!

If you're an experienced UX/UI Designer that wants to work for a globally recognised, market leading company, then please apply and/or get in touch with Jack Steven at Cathcart Technology",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQGv9hpgdPOH4zQgFHQEfyd7n_J1zHCIuSKDgcBXgE&s,"['1 month ago', '£40K–£55K a year', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,1 month ago,Full-time,,2022-12-11 00:24:44.915397,ui ux designer,Glasgow,

3,UI/UX Designer,Netcall,United Kingdom,via Indeed,"UI / UX Designer

Permanent, Home Based

Are you a UI / UX designer with experience using Adobe Creative Suite who enjoys creating and coding front end interfaces?

As a UI / UX Designer here at Netcall, you’ll predominantly be creating front end interfaces for our low code software platform, Liberty Create. Create is awesome and extremely versatile, it enables our customers to build custom applications quickly and easily to automate tasks, saving time and improving their customers’ experience…without the need to be a software developer!

You’re highly adept using Adobe Creative Suite, you’ll be creating and coding webpages for our clients, they’ll need to look great, be highly functional and really easy to use.

You’ll need to gather the requirements of the customer to get an idea of what they want their pages to look like and how they want them to function. You’ll then build a prototype page in Adobe to get the right look and feel for the layout, incorporating logos, graphics, text... and buttons on the different screens.

You’ll ideally have worked on a broad range of projects for different customers, perhaps you have worked for a web development agency managing multiple client projects which present different challenges which you need to adapt to.

You enjoy coming up with solutions to challenging design tasks, there’s plenty to get your teeth into here! There’s loads of opportunity to get your creative juices flowing – we’re always looking for new ideas and innovative ways of solving problems.

Why should you join Netcall?

· Reward – we are offering a competitive package, plus a whole host of other benefits from pension to Perkbox.

· Flexible working – we moved to remote working during the pandemic and it is working brilliantly, we also have offices in Bedford and Poole if you want a change of scenery.

· We are problem solvers – our software solves real-world problems, whether it’s automating laborious processes, via our suite of Low-code, AI and RPA technologies or centralising communication through call centre conversational messaging capability. What we call the Liberty Intelligent Automation platform.

· We are always learning – the day job is very important, but it’s also great to learn new things and we encourage our colleagues to grow. Our Academy is accessible not only to our staff but to all our customers and partners.

About You

Well versed in the use of Adobe Creative Suite.

Experienced in UI and UX design on a wide range of projects, it would be great if you had previously worked for a web development agency on multiple client projects.

Ideally some experience designing webpages for a SaaS platform / product.

You take ownership over your projects, but also enjoy sharing ideas with the team to gain collective input and problem solving.

You may have some knowledge of Vue.JS and Bulma CSS framework, though not essential.

Due to the nature of the role, you are expected to gain and maintain Non-Police Personnel Vetting Level 3 (NPPV3) clearance and therefore it is essential that you have held continuous residency in the UK for the past 3 years.

We’re committed to providing a supportive and inclusive culture and environment for you to work in. This environment recognises and supports ways to balance your personal needs, alongside the professional needs of our business.

If you would like some flexibility, then please discuss this with the hiring manager, and your request will be reviewed subject to business needs.

We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve. Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances

5,User Interface Designer,Cathcart Technology,Anywhere,via Check-A-Salary,"A disruptive start-up in Glasgow is looking for a UI Designer to join the team. The company have identified an opportunity in a monopoly market that they believe they can shake up with new, end-to-end software and have managed to secure backing for this already.

They’ve started to bring together a highly-skilled team to begin the build of this new software after having extremely positive feedback through successful talks of their beta product.

Ideally, you’ll have experience of working across end-to-end design and experience of working across B2B products. If not, experience building customer facing applications would work fine too. There isn’t lots and lots of research to be done within the role as the founders of the company have continuously been doing research over the last year, so the role will be more focused on UX & UI Design. They've recently brought in a UX Designer to the team and are now looking for someone that is more focused on UI & Visual Design that will complement... the team.

The software that the company will be building involves 3D elements, so you’ll work very closely with the 3D/Visual expert as well as the CTO, Developers and founders of the company.

They aren’t looking for someone that has years and years of experience, as long as you’ve got experience across at least one product, that is fine with them. If you are super experienced, they are happy to consider you as well, but they do have a slight preference for someone a bit rougher around the edges.

The company is based in Glasgow, but they can offer fully remote working – there will be on-site meetings every now and then so they’re ideally looking for someone to at least be based in Scotland.

Salary for the role is up to £45,000 but they could potentially go above this for someone that is perfect.

Collaboration: as a fast growing small business we all work together across multiple workstreams. We have a flat structure and encourage frank discussion, honesty and openness.
Learning and development: the blockchain space is developing at an incredibly fast rate. Having a growth mentality and being open to continuous learning is an important part of our culture.

Diversity and Inclusion: inclusiveness is one of our blockchain’s core strengths, and in the same way we are committed to inclusiveness across all diversity dimensions. We are also actively looking for talent outside of the immediate blockchain space. What we primarily look for is general markers of excellence and ambition.

9,Senior UI/UX Designer,Hi Mum! Said Dad,United Kingdom,via LinkedIn,"Senior UX/UI Designer

Reporting to the Experience Design Director

Hello! We're Hi Mum! Said Dad.

We're one of the UK's most awarded and innovative digital product studios with a ten-year pedigree in innovation and digital product design. We design for real needs and build digital products that people truly value. In the Strategy and Design team, we're at the product front-line - crafting digital products for mobile, web, voice, and exciting emerging technologies.

We believe creating innovative digital experiences is both a science and an art, so we champion rigorous research and testing as well as giving the Strategy and Design team the space to follow a flexible creative process.

We’re a close-knit team that believe learning from each other is essential to our personal growth. We have dedicated time every week devoted to developing each other’s skills and critiquing each other’s work - even if we’re not on the same project.

As a Senior UX/UI Designer in the Strategy and Design... team, you’ll be involved in every step of the way of creating new digital products from scratch; from research, product strategy, UX design, UI design, and user testing, to collaborating with developers through build and launch.

In return, you’ll get the opportunity to grow your craft and leadership skills, taking on responsibility that stretches you in a way that matches your career aspirations.

Who we’re looking for

We’re looking for someone who has played a role in creating a range of new digital products and is passionate to grow their skillset.

You’ll have a strategic, solution-focused mindset with the ability to translate concepts and ideas into practical and tactical outcomes. You’ll play an integral part of a team that will deliver world-class digital products and experiences for our globally recognised clients.

Your main strength lies in UX design. However, you are also competent at UI design when needed. You’ll have a basic understanding of research, strategy, visual design, and service design. While you’re not necessarily an expert in all of these, you’ll know what good looks like and can have a decent conversation about them. You’re a keen learner and are excited to develop your skills in these areas.

Above all, you’ll be an excellent communicator having presented work and explained your design rationale to a variety of stakeholders.

What Will You Be Doing?

You’ll usually be working on one project at a time, bringing highly effective digital products and experiences to life. You’ll be working in multidisciplinary teams - collaborating with other designers, strategists, developers, product managers, and project managers. As a Senior UX/UI Designer, you’ll be coaching and supporting more junior designers, while in turn being supported by a Principal Experience Designer. You’ll be reporting into our Experience Design Director and Managing Partner.

In a little more detail, you will:
• Usually work on one project at a time. Occasionally two.
• Work directly with the client executing all the necessary design work - creating deliverables such as user flows, mockups and prototypes
• Work across a broad range of projects spanning websites, mobile apps, services and voice skills
• Coach and inspire more junior members of the team; demonstrating best practises, and promoting a culture of collaboration
• Work with strategists and designers to ensure that products are research-driven, validated with user testing and deliver against business objectives
• Support the costing and planning activity of design deliverables, report on the status of deliverables and quickly notify the project management team of risks
• Design and run both internal and client-facing workshops
• Contribute to company culture, blog posts, social media, white papers, as well as attending or speaking at industry conferences
• And most importantly; be part of a team that creates exceptional design work

Essential experience
• Been hands on at every step of creating a new digital product
• Worked as part of a multidisciplinary team following an agile approach
• Designed native experiences for both iOS and Android, and understand how experiences differ between the two
• Designed responsive web-based applications across different devices
• Collaborated with developers to understand technical constraints and create appropriate deliverables
• Communicated the underlying principles and rationale of designs, constructing compelling narratives that sell ideas to stakeholders and team members
• Created or maintained design systems and component libraries
• Proficient in both Sketch and Figma

Bonus experience
• Worked in both agency and in-house design roles
• Worked in a startup environment
• Worked in Fintech, Auto, Energy sectors
• Created new voice skills
• Service design - both documenting existing services and creating new services

And what will you get in return?
• A competitive salary
• 25 days holiday (plus bank holidays)
• ½ day off on your birthday
• A great pension scheme
• Health and dental insurance (it can even be used towards a spa day)
• Craft-focused skills development
• Sector-specific training courses help take your career to the next level",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSXOzN0sVSW2Vmbrun1qTD_NVH0L6XDBjG0EHecP_4&s,"['27 days ago', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,27 days ago,Full-time,,2022-12-11 00:25:24.179941,ui ux designer,Glasgow,

4,Lead UI / UX Designer,Post Urban,Anywhere,via LinkedIn,"Important:

We have a need for a part-time contractor who can work remotely anywhere in Canada, the US, the UK or Europe. This is an ongoing need and could develop into a permanent part-time contract or staff position.

Who we are: Chelo is the latest AI Tech startup to come out of Post Urban Ventures, a highly successful deep tech AI venture builder. We are a team of serial entrepreneurs with PhDs from Cambridge, MIT, and UCL that is, fully funded, and on a mission to transform the way companies operate, grow, implement their vision, create cultures and products. You can learn more about us here: https://posturban.vc/

What we are working on: We operate in the deep tech AI space, where we focus on applying fundamental science to business problems as we create solutions. As such, we are often developing prototypes to prove our fundamental science hypotheses and we need help creating product on top of these scientific prove outs. For Chelo, we are focusing on the application of graph... structures and AI to knowledge base creation.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced Senior UX Designer to lead the research activities that will help define and drive the future of our products. You’ll be working on a fast-paced, entrepreneurial team in order to discover, explore, and validate Chelo's business propositions as we grow the product. Any experience with: database visualization, graph databases or large qualitative data knowledge bases would be helpful in this role

What we are looking for: In this role here are the key competencies we are looking for.
• Creative: You will help define the problem—not just help influence the solution. You will come up with practical ways to formulate research and design questions, explore problem spaces, and surface insights before having all the information.
• Quick. You can scale—up and down—your research activities to reflect the need: not everything needs to be completely understood or take weeks to deliver value. You look for opportunities to leverage other learning's and insights, even if they aren’t a perfect fit.
• Unconventional. We work on complex challenges that invite bold and unorthodox approaches. You’re not afraid to suggest something that sounds odd or risky, and you build on the ideas of others.
• Comfortable with iterative change. We often need to quickly change direction based on what we’ve learned—or still need to learn. We can be working on more than one idea at a time, ideas can move forward, or ideas can be shelved.
• Embracing ambiguity. We deal with challenges that no one else has tackled yet. We make decisions based on the data we have, knowing there are areas of the problem space we just don’t know much about yet.
• Experimental: Open to trying new ways of doing things. We embrace experimentation, look for inspiration in non-traditional spaces, and measure things to see what works.
• Imperfect. You don't let perfection be the enemy of the good or good enough, to start.

If this is you and you are comfortable working in undefined creative space, we would love to here from you",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-J80JBZ-agCFgDKg6UXbDUfEl4DZr0hYdt_TIU9w&s,"['22 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Part-time']",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,22 days ago,Part-time,True,2022-12-11 00:25:30.940918,ui ux designer,Glasgow,
