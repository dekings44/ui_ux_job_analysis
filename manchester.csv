Ballotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people.

When we launched in 2007, we did not go out of our way to seek new readers. Starting with our small team of visionary idealists, nerds, and aspiring political journalists, we just wrote the best unbiased online articles we could, especially about ballot measures.

Readers found those articles in droves. It turns out there was an unclaimed audience out there people who wanted straightforward facts about political issues, and were willing to read at length instead of just scanning the headlines.

If you build it, they will come : '' our readers came to our neutral oasis in growing numbers; we’ve had many millions of lifetime pageviews, we reached nearly half of all voters in 2020, and, in the month surrounding the November 2020 election, we were the 77th most-visited website in the U.S.

We’ve come to realize that we need to meet our readers where they are. In doing so, over the past five years, we’ve grown our email newsletter program from infancy to include more than 1,000,000 opt-in subscribers with more than a dozen newsletters to choose from.

We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it, including on mobile phones while you’re standing in the voting booth.

We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential to the preservation of our great civilization in a world where too many others are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational posts and the irrational decisions they foster.

Braintrust is working to change the way freelance works - for good.
• JOB TYPE: Freelance, Contract Position (no agencies/C2C - see notes below)
• LOCATION: Remote - Work from anywhere
• HOURLY RANGE: Our client is looking to pay $50 - $85/hr
• ESTIMATED DURATION: 20h/week - Long-term

THE OPPORTUNITY

Required Technical Chops
• Ability to design UI and UX using Figma (and other relevant tools)
• Trading experience as indicated above
• User Interviews / research
• Prototyping and orchestrating user tests. Specifically, you will be required to review recordings and/or observe traders using the application via livestream and generating design insights to improve their experience on the application.

Nice-to-have Skills
• HTML / CSS
• TailwindCSS / Chakra UI
• JavaScript (React) What you'll be working on

The client is currently building a day-trading application (with an existing team of three developers), and needs a UI/UX Designer to join the team. The high-level objective is to put the power of automated trading into the hands of day-traders who typically trade manually. The ideal UI/UX designer should have experience in at least one of the following:
• Building a trading application (for previous employers or clients)
• Building trading algorithms
• Actively trading the markets in any asset class (stocks, options, crypto, forex etc) 4. Familiarity with day-trading applications such as DAS Trader Pro, Sterling Trader Pro, Thinkorswim, Trader Workstation etc

While the emphasis on this position is to design intuitive error-reducing interfaces for traders who typically made trading decisions using sub-second data, it is highly desirable if the designer has basic development skills to convert designs into HTML/CSS/JS that the team can use a starting point for feature development.

The ideal candidate will work ona part time basis (10 - 20 hours per week), and will work with the client to design a trader-centric experience that will be implemented by the development team. The candidate will also participate in twice-a-week meetings to provide updates and help guide the direction of the product from a design perspective. The client is a customer-driven Product Manager by day, and is able to bring to bear his significant experience in developing digital products whilst guaranteeing a respectful and fulfilling working experience.

The product is expected to launch in February 2023, however, more features will be developed post launch and there exists the possibility of a long-term relationship depending on performance and fit.

If this interests you, please share your portfolio emphasizing your experience designing trading apps. Years of experience don't matter, just bring your A-game.

9,Senior UI/UX Designer,Databento,Anywhere,via Talentify,"The financial industry is growing at a record pace, but our data providers are still stuck in the past — with cumbersome onboarding processes, complicated APIs, slow infrastructure, and expensive licensing costs.

Databento is the next-generation market data provider — with the radical idea that you should only pay for the data that you use. We power the world's largest finance and fintech... institutions and lower the barrier of entry for small startups.

Since starting in 2019, we've raised over $27.8M in funding and have over 2,000 companies signed up pre-launch. Our team consists of former data users from firms like Two Sigma, Belvedere, Pico, Bloomberg, Pinterest, and Google.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency.
Responsibilities

As a Senior UI/UX Designer, you'll be working closely with our product and engineering teams to design and improve on our core product and implement growth strategies to widen our user base. You'll be:
• Designing and improving everything from end-to-end user flows to visual optimizations for specific features.
• Implementing both high-fidelity prototypes and low-fidelity wireframes.
• Working with engineers to bridge the gap between design and technical implementation.
• Working with external and internal (CEO, CTO, community team) stakeholders to identify and prioritize user needs.
• Conducting user testing and assimilating customer feedback.
• Planning and conducting user research and interviews.
• Motivating design-oriented decisions and standards firm-wide.
The product

Our core products are an API service and an enterprise web application. Here are some key highlights of our product strategy:
• Product-led growth with low touch sales. We rely on product features like referrals, team invites and self-signup process instead of a traditional sales pipeline to scale our user base.
• Enterprise-grade, consumer-scale product. (Like Slack or GitHub.) Our competitors adopt a traditional enterprise SaaS strategy, opting to hide their product behind a ""request for quote/demo"" and employing a high touch onboarding process with big sales teams. We believe we can outpace their growth by targeting the same enterprises with an institutional-grade product that instead has the ease of adoption and transparency of a consumer product.
• Targeting a developer-centric user base. (Like AWS, Stripe or Plaid.) We pursue the exponential effect of providing products that enable developers to build an ecosystem of other products and tools.
• Fast iteration. With multiple deployments per day.
• Putting product needs before technical limitations. We have great engineers who will walk over hot coals to actualize difficult product requirements.
What makes being a UI/UX designer at Databento exciting
• You'll impact high-level product decisions as well as shape product design culture. As one of our initial design hires, you will largely influence the product design culture and help set the stage for our product's growth. As such, we value designers who take initiative and can design with ambiguity, and can contribute feedback on how to improve our design processes.
• We're focused on product-led growth, not sales-led growth. We resonate with the pain that design is less prioritized in many enterprise products. At Databento, our product is the central driver of growth, and you'll be at the center of developing our product experience. Not only are our founders always raising the bar of our product's design quality, but our engineers, who usually fall into target user profile, contribute to advocating for and improving user experience.
• You'll receive timely compensation rewards that reflect your impact Here, we believe in giving kudos when it's due. We measure your value based on your work and direct contributions you put in, and reward frequently and accordingly when it comes to pay and promotions. Additionally, we offer competitive base pay that is comparable to other top tech companies.
Requirements
• 5+ years of experience as a UI/UX Designer or Product Designer.
• Proficiency with design tools (Figma, Adobe).
• Experience collaborating with engineers and other designers.
• Experience performing user research, user flow mapping and presenting options to stakeholders.
• Understanding of color theory, typography, interaction design, motion principles and visual hierarchy.
• Keen eye for design improvements and visual detail.
• A strong portfolio.
• Bachelor's degree in a design or technical field, such as HCI, Design or Information Architecture.
Bonus qualifications
• Experience with designing enterprise web applications or API products (e.g. Stripe, Twilio, Plaid, Segment, Algolia, Agora).
• Industry knowledge in fintech.
• Familiarity with responsive design.
• Familiarity with collecting user metrics and analyzing user sessions (e.g. Amplitude, Heap, Mixpanel).
• Experience with front-end web development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript).
• Exposure to product management at high growth startup.

Please include a sample portfolio or website in your application, if possible.

Our team is made up of serial entrepreneurs including a Co-Founder & CEO, Co-Founder & CMO, Chief of Operations, and a Product Manager.

Our Environment:
Inspiring & Innovative
Trustworthy, Dependable and Committed
Cutting Edge Technology
Masters of Planning

Let’s face it. You’ve always dreamed of working with a start-up from the ground up where your brilliant design ideas could be applied to a wicked cool new product. We’re talking about a product that will not only revolutionize an industry, but more importantly for your sake, one that you and your friends will use, and one that you’ll be happy to brag about. Sound intriguing?

If you think you’ve got enough spunk and also possess some mad skills, keep reading.

We’re looking to bring on a talented UI/UX web designer with excellent HTML and CSS skills to join our dynamic team. The right individual will have experience designing User Interfaces for web and mobile applications, will have good typographical skills, a strong foundation in design principles, semantic markup, web standards. We’ll be looking for a solid and passionate designer who will enjoy leading the user experience efforts from interaction, usability, and graphic design all the way to HTML and CSS. They’ll also be focused on continuous UI improvement based on evolving requirements and customer feedback.

Within the context of a team, the designer will have prime responsibility for making sure the product being built provides an awesome user experience. This means communicating with the product manager, developers, and any other stakeholders to address concerns and then find solutions. While we stress the importance of functionality and usability, we still expect a high level of visual refinement to our products. An excellent understanding and use of grids, typography, color, etc. are essential for building quality, compelling products.

The UI designer creates prototypes and wireframes, works closely with project teams and product management, documents the design in technical specs, and creates UI code (HTML, CSS) that can be utilized by the development team. The UI designer will also ensure that the design is consistent throughout. Staying up to date with the latest UI technologies is second nature to the right candidate and they’ll also inherently possess the creativity to conceive new breakthrough UI approaches. Jetsonify is currently operating in “stealth mode” for the time being, but feel free to get in touch for more info if you think that you’re the rock star that we’re looking for.

Ideally we’d love for someone to join our team full time in Cambridge/Boston, MA. But seeing as how life is rarely ideal, we’d also be open to talking to designers in San Fran or Atlanta. If you’re reading this and you’re outside of these areas but still think you deserve a shot at the title, we’ll entertain your plea for working virtually if you make an impressive case for us to consider, in 3 sentences or less.

Duties/Responsibilities

• Design the User Interfaces for complex software applications for the web, desktop and mobile applications.
• Participate and lead design reviews.
• Develop detailed design specifications based on functional requirements and the created prototypes.
• Work with engineers and product manager to ensure the product is being developed as per the design specifications.
• Educate the organization in UI best practices and new technologies.
• Work with teams on early prototypes that help gather ideas and shape future product enhancements.

Required Skills/Education

• 3-5 years experience in UI design, user interaction, and/or UX design

More About Depict

Depict is a new medium for visual experiences. The Depict ecosystem delivers incredibly stunning and visceral art experiences by enabling people to access and display an entirely new art medium in their own spaces. The work is exclusive to Depict, curated by our in-house curatorial team and previously unavailable elsewhere.

Depict protects the artwork with technology that enables scarcity and provenance tracking, so it is something customers can invest in and re-sell down the road. To display the work, Depict created its own device, a stunning 50” museum quality ultra-high definition display purpose built for delivering incredible visual experiences in interior spaces.

Why digital art: A convergence of social and technological trends has created ideal conditions for the digital art economy to thrive. In the meantime, the quality of modern 4k displays, and the potential for lightweight, flexible screens means that digital art can look beautiful in homes and businesses everywhere.
