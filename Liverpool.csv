I'm currently partnered with a web and software development agency based in Crewe who are looking for a Creative Designer to join their team.

The Role
You will design the UI/UX on a variety of digital solutions for our clients including brochure websites, e-commerce platforms, online portals, and software applications. You will take ownership of the entire design process, from helping to collect insights from the client, to designing the UI/UX, reviewing concepts with the client, and handing over to the front-end development team. There may also be opportunity to work on several branding and print design projects (subject to experience).

More specifically, you will:
• Gather insights from the client and develop a thorough understanding of their business (market position, products/services), and users (demographics, psychographics, behavioural) to inform design decisions.
• Design UI/UX concepts for entire systems - driven by insights.
• Present... concepts to clients via screenshare calls, discuss the concepts, and provide rationale behind key design decisions.
• Design responsive views for concepts.
• Iterate design concepts until we reach final concept, working in a collaborative way with project stakeholders throughout the Design phase.
• Liaise with the Technical Lead to ensure that design concepts meet client briefs and functional requirements.
• Hand over designs to the front-end development team for front-end implementation and provide guidance to front-end developers when required.
• Provide updates to Project Support on the progress of Design concepts, identify and communicate any potential blockers.
• Proactively engage with the latest trends in Design and share ideas with the Head of Design.

You
• You will have experience in creating brilliant conceptual web design.
• On a personal level, a creative mind is key, and you must possess a perfectionist approach to detail. A calm and collected character is important as this is a fast-paced environment with several ongoing projects, all of which are time-sensitive.
• Finally, communication skills are critical as you will be working closely with several stakeholders (internal and external). A key component of this role is to effectively gather design requirements from clients, and present your concepts accordingly (via screenshare or face-to-face).
• Ideally, you will have experience as a UX/UI Designer in a similar role, preferably within an agency.

3,Senior UX Designer,cinch,Anywhere,via AngelList,"cinch is transforming the UK’s car buying experience. We’re taking one of the last industries to go digital and disrupting it with trailblazing tech and beautifully-simple customer experiences. Now as we accelerate from start-up to scale-up, we’re hiring talented, ambitious and passionate people to join us and drive our success.

Why join cinch? We’re dedicated to building and being a great technology business. Together, we’re creating a supportive, non-bureaucratic culture that is every bit as faff-free as our online customer experience, where communication is open, decisions are made quickly, and everybody has the freedom to bring in new ideas. Of course, working together doesn’t mean we’re in the same room every day. Our teams spend around 60% of their time working remotely – and that’s not going to change.
• The role *

Our business is built around good UX – but we give our UX team the autonomy and opportunity to get involved in the full lifecycle from user research through to... design. After all, making car buying faff-free depends on us creating simple, intuitive user-centric experiences. You’ll use a variety of methods and techniques to really get to know our target audience – their needs, their intentions, their dreams – and keep them front-of-mind throughout the design process. We’re not keen on ‘departments’ here – we work closely with people from different disciplines, sharing our specialist knowledge, exploring new ideas and collaborating to create best-in-class online experiences.

This is a challenging role - we’re taking a 100-year-old industry online for the first time. There are no right answers and no set processes to follow. You’ll need to think on your feet, stay creative and be open to trying, failing, and trying again. We are.
• The person *

Good UX is crucial at cinch. You’ll need a creative and innovative approach to iterative design, as well as a good understanding of lean principles. Sketching, wireframing, prototyping and UI design will all come naturally, as will the ability to present to and communicate with the wider team and senior stakeholders. You’ll need to be resilient, agile and confident enough to try new things and share big ideas.

We’re big on continuous learning, and we build Communities of Practice where our multi-talented teams can share ideas, kick the tyres on new technology and think differently. We’re moving fast, experimenting, learning and reinventing as we go. Can you keep up?

If you’re open to new ideas, you’re ready to collaborate, you’re ready to embrace new technologies - together, we’ll do great things. Apply now.

cinch focuses on Infrastructure, Automotive, Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, and Product Design. Their company has offices in London, Manchester, and Hampshire. They have a mid-size team that's between 51-200 employees.

Our projects

Our projects typically fall into three... areas:

Design-led websites – visually beautiful websites

Product development/research – concept development, emerging design trends and user testing

You’ll be working in a sociable, open-plan Shrewsbury office when we're not on lockdown, with a supportive development team in a great culture.

About the company

We're an established digital product studio, working on an eclectic mix of custom web applications and apps for clients all over the world. From start-ups to international brands like Sony, Volvo, Tesco and Volkswagen Group.

In addition to our client work, we also have several in-house digital projects and are building our own SaaS platform.

Role

As a mid - senior-level designer, you’ll be working with an experienced, close-knit team of strategists, creatives and developers who learn and grow together.

You’ll be involved in every part of the design process, including strategy sessions with clients, idea development, building wireframes and prototypes, designing interfaces and working with our developers on final delivery.

Beyond the basics – typography, interaction and human-centred design – the thing we’re looking for most is the ability to deliver elegant, innovative, pixel-perfect interface designs that will set our clients' products above the rest.

Most of your work will be on greenfield web application projects for clients, designing brands and products from the ground up. The rest of your time will be spent visualising new features for existing applications and mobile apps, including our in-house web platforms, and curating our profile across our communications, social and website.

Salary and benefits: Our remuneration package includes a competitive salary and above-law benefits, including 32 paid days off per year (*plus your birthday!) and a great company pension. And of course, bean-to-cup coffee and a stocked kitchen will keep you fuelled while you work side-by-side with other talented, committed, enthusiastic members of a growing team.

The ideal person in this role will match the values of our existing team; smart and quick to use your initiative, with a lot of drive, a natural love of development and good-natured when working in a team.

You’ll be happy to share your opinions and experience, suggest solutions to challenges and support others.

You’ll be happy to work hard in a team, determined to do the best you can to make sure the project journey is enjoyable for everyone involved

• Facilitate and participate in workshops and discussions to promote the communication of ideas
• Work with developers for handover and design review
• Participate in design research, user research and validation testing
• Participate in the communication of your work to the client
• Work within and respect a client’s brand but also adapt and evolve it to current digital standards.

• Bring systems thinking in order to create robust design systems that can scale effectively

Must-haves

• References for your accomplishments as a designer

Environment

The studio is based in the town centre of Shrewsbury, one of the finest market towns in England. Lockdown has proven how well we work remotely, and so we're open to applications from those who would prefer to work remotely, as well as those who love the energy of working with a team in an open-plan office.

We provide an open, friendly and collaborative working environment, where teammates solve challenges together, share knowledge, and present to each other on emerging trends in technology, software engineering and self-development.

Culture

Dress: We dress how we like in the studio - it’s important that we all feel comfortable while we work - and only brush up for meetings and if we have a client visiting.

Flexibility: Outside of lockdowns, we work together as a team in the studio most days. We’ve learnt to be flexible over lockdown, so don’t mind if you want to work from home occasionally.

Location: We’re a 5-minute walk from the centre of Shrewsbury, just across the river, by the Theatre and right next to Frankwell car park, which means you’ll always find it easy to get into work. A couple of our team members cycle, and there are also bike racks in the studio.

Remote working for this role is also an option. Ideally, you'd live close enough to join the studio for the odd team event, but it's not essential, as long as you're in our timezone so you can work in sync with the rest of the team.

Our values

Our success starts and ends with our team. We aim to inspire our people and provide a connection to how what we do has a larger impact on our clients, their teams, and their communities.

We’re a growing, supportive and collaborative team, working together to build exciting and innovative projects. The great thing about joining a company like us is that there are lots of opportunities to learn, and directions for your career to grow, which will depend on your interests, where you excel and what you aspire to be.

Our core values guide and influence everything we do:
• Comradery - We are in it together and have the good of the company, our clients and the wider community at heart;
• Mastery - We aim to reach the highest standards, personally and professionally and share knowledge to create an environment of learning and growth;
• Adventure - We push outside of our comfort zone with curiosity, explore what’s possible and enjoy the ride;
• All-in - We are confident in the decisions we make, and committed to seeing through projects to a successful outcome.

Our design team is growing, so we’re looking for a Senior UI Designer who can create amazing new visual concepts and experiences that will delight our clients and their customers, and that are as innovative as they are impactful.

You will be a senior and active member of the design team who has experience of working in agile teams and enjoys close collaboration with UX designers and developers - from idea to execution. You will be able to make deliberate design decisions and to translate any given user-experience journey into a smooth and intuitive interaction.

You’ll lead the UI for clients, so we’re after someone who’s with management experience and can direct junior designers as well as build great relationships with our customers. You’ll have a great portfolio of work... with proven mobile experience. You must have a passion for visual design – always in touch with the latest trends and looking for fresh inspiration.

You will:
• Lead the design of the full visual experience across the whole range of products we deliver
• Create high-level visual concepts that are as original as they are impactful,
both hand sketches and in software tools
• Present to clients and colleagues, communicating and selling your ideas with confidence
• Work in close partnership with Senior UX Designer to create innovative and intuitive visual designs that meet user and product requirements
• Work with the UX designer to further develop wireframes, storyboards, user flows, process flow and site maps where necessary.
• Work with the sales team to create high quality screen concepts that demonstrate to prospective clients initial ideas, how their brand can come to life within the context of the brief, and the calibre of Design at Apadmi.
• Design interactive prototypes that effectively explore and communicate process, interaction and design concepts.
• Produce high-quality visual designs in a variety of software tools that can be implemented by a development team.
• Analyse requirements and provide accurate estimates for the design phase of a project.
• Deliver design work on programs of any size with minimal oversight.
• Be experienced working in an agile/scrum development process.
• Give clear UI direction and helpful feedback to junior designers, to develop stronger designs and their careers

What you’ll need
• 4+ years of digital design experience, ideally in a digital agency or consultancy.
• A brilliant portfolio of UI designs, impactful and effective and with a significant number of mobile examples
• A passion for technology.
• Good knowledge of current official UI guidelines for mobile platforms.
• Expert in UI design software such as Figma and a good working knowledge of the primary Adobe apps (i.e. Photoshop, Illustrator and (to a lesser extent) After Effects).
• Knowledge of good UI design and interaction design practices and trends across multiple platforms, including web and mobile
• Experience of Scrum, SAFE, or other Agile principles.
• Good presentation skills
• Strong creative, organisational, problem solving and time-management skills.
• Must have been in client-facing roles and have project experience in working with teams on different projects.

Why work for Apadmi
• We are at the forefront of Digital Impact in the UK. We work with some of the brands, creating the future digital product solutions, and you will be able to look back and proudly say “I did that”.
• You will be surrounded by a team of experts, challenging yourself and others, to work with clients on solutions that will deliver real change and value.
• We offer an excellent remuneration package and excellent career progression prospects.
• We want to support you, so our life insurance, income protection scheme and group pension scheme are all included in our employee package.
• Not only that, we’re driven by your needs and your personal development. Together with your team leader, we’ll help you set objectives and track progress, whilst creating a personal development plan shaped around your needs and interests.
• Remote working has become the new normal for us at Apadmi, but should you wish to have a change of scenery, our custom-built Salford Quays office with free on-site parking provides a relaxed, socially distanced, environment to work in. Here you’ll find a fully stocked kitchen, a dozen state-of-the-art collaboration spaces and free-on-site secure parking.

Remote First - Manchester (WeWork base)

Paying around £50,000

Would you like to join one of Manchester's latest innovative start ups?

This is a chance to join a start up who have just been injected with cash in order to help develop and continue to grow an already successful product.

You will join a team of 7 which is a mix of experienced engineers including a highly successful CTO who is the brainchild of the product.

Whilst they now have over 75 customers using the product, including some of Manchester's best venues, they see room to grow even further.

Now they have a working model they would like to refine the product in order to make it more user friendly and consistently high performing.

This is why they need to hire their first UX Designer to work closely with the development teams to help improve to work end to end and have a real impact on the user experience.

The benefits structure is still being developed but one thing this organisation can... offer is flexibility and work life balance in abundance.

Sounds like it could be a good fit?

0,Senior UX Designer,Auto Trader,"Manchester, UK",via Adzuna,"About the Role:

We’re on a mission to make buying and selling cars an easy and straightforward process. As a Senior UX Designer, you will be key to enabling this for the thousands of retailers that use our applications and sites each month. Working day-to-day with developers, user researchers and product managers you will be involved in every aspect of the product development process, from discovery through to delivery.

Your role will involve taking responsibility for product design within a cross-functional team, continuously improving our experiences and building continuity across web and mobile apps.

You’ll be working with product managers, engineers, and researchers to guide our products through both discovery and iterative delivery tracks, contributing strongly to the full lifecycle of design. This would include running and participating in design workshops and sprints as well as designing, prototyping and testing ideas with your team and in more formal testing... environments.

Working alongside the rest of your team you’ll be playing a key part of decision making throughout the product lifecycle: articulating when and where design thinking and design craft are needed and communicating the value of each. You’ll also play a key role in influencing, persuading, and evangelising our design system and user experience design within your product team and the wider design team.

We are a very data-driven company at heart, so while working at pace you’ll have the confidence to make decisions, knowing when to use qualitative or quantitative data and when it’s acceptable to rely on your knowledge and experience. Our work requires us to be flexible so you’ll be able to switch from high level, big picture thinking to the detail of user stories and UI designs.

Our collaborative approach is key to our success, so as part of the broader design team you’ll be learning from and helping others, identifying and implementing improvements to the way we work. We’d want you to give and welcome feedback and critique from other team members and designers to help encourage personal and professional growth. As a Senior Designer, you’ll also help coach and mentor more junior designers or colleagues in other roles.

What We're Looking For:

Experience with end-to-end UX/product design in a commercial environment - including scoping, researching, prototyping and testing.
Experience in designing digital products for a B2B audience.
Comfortable working closely with developers & testers to bring products to life.
Experience with user testing/research and using data to define outcomes and measure improvements.
Experience in interaction design work, sketches, storyboards, prototypes, and visual design. We would be interested in seeing examples of these in your portfolio.
Appreciation of front-end development technologies.
Good communication & influencing skills, and the ability to synthesise different perspectives.
Although not a requirement, useful experience includes:

Experience of working with design systems.
In house/client-side experience.

Benefits and more:

We offer a competitive salary plus private healthcare, 28 days holiday, plus half-day office closures on both Christmas and New Year's Eve, pension and lots of extras that you can personalise to suit your lifestyle.

Our hybrid working model, Connected Working, gives you various options, including combining office with home working and flexible start and finish times.

To help you get the best out of the working week, we’ve split it into fixed, flex and focus days. Everybody has two fixed office days with their team, a flex day where you decide the day you come in, and two focus days which can be spent at home or in the office.
