8,Senior UI/UX Digital Product Designer,Spotlight Sports Group,"Bristol, UK",via Sports Tech Jobs,"Senior Digital Product Designer
• Fully remote US based candidates will also be considered
• This is a hybrid role (remote and Bristol office, for UK candidates) - You will also need to come into the London office at least once a month (subsidised)

Spotlight Sports Group is a global media and technology company specialising in sports betting content and data. We have over 500 staff, and operate multiple award-winning B2C brands including Racing Post, MyRacing, Soccerbase & Free Super Tips in the UK. In the US we operate Pickswise & Fantasy Alarm. Our other businesses in the group are ICS-digital and ICS-translate. Our global B2B division provides sports betting and fantasy sports content, media partnerships (including a joint venture with Spanish publisher, AS) & much more.

The Product Design and Research team are a key element of the business transformation to digital and the future success of Spotlight Sports Group. We are driven to provide timely, authoritative content and... experiences so sports enthusiasts can be deeply informed and inspired and bettors can bet with confidence and ease. This role would be working with our Sports Affiliate team, mainly working on our US brand - Pickswise, helping to bring premium sports data and content for NFL, basketball, baseball, hockey and more, to sport enthusiasts and sports bettors alike. We have first generation products out in the US and UK/Europe; we’re looking for someone to help us take these products to the next level of audience engagement as we provide more content, tools and data to our users.

We’re looking for a Senior Product Designer to work on our Pickswise brand - our flagship sports product for the US market. You would also work on some emerging brands for other markets including Latin America and Asia, as they come online. If you like working in (or want to work in) sport, working with data visualisation, solving complex business problems involving a hefty amount of data, insight, and sports analysis (because you like geeking out) with a highly collaborative team designing products that are pushing into new markets across the world, this could be the role you’re looking for.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is a mid level or recently became senior who wants to build up their experience - learning, progressing and contributing to a larger design approach. You’ll have the opportunity to influence stakeholders across the business and mentor more junior designers, while being given the room to develop and push your craft.

The role:
• This role is a senior level hybrid role of UX and UI disciplines, more heavily weighted towards User Interface Design - we need someone who has deep UI knowledge and interaction design experience.
• A good candidate for this role is someone who enjoys collaboration and bringing both designers and stakeholders on a journey to creating the best user centred product.
• This role will include mentoring other mid level designers - thus it would suit someone looking to move to the next phase of their career.
• Having enthusiasm for sport will be a huge benefit for this role. Any knowledge of US sports like NFL, basketball, baseball, hockey, etc. is a very big plus.

Aspects of this role include:
• Working with product owners, researchers and other designers on the team to identify and define usability issues and opportunities within our digital product suite of sport affiliate websites and apps
• Collaborating with User Research to understand current users and users in growth markets both in Europe and internationally (e.g. the US).
• Running / owning larger pieces of work, including working with other designers to distribute work and ensure high quality levels are maintained throughout the projects.
• Working closely with the Product Design Manager to help improve ways or working, identify areas for optimisation and encourage exploration into areas ripe for innovation.
• Designing, prototyping and building digital product designs for larger flows and smaller features for responsive websites and mobile apps.
• Prepping screens and prototypes for user testing (both lab and/or remote testing)
• Working closely with development in a modified Agile environment to ensure solutions are technically feasible, as well as being involved in design handover and UAT processes.
• Presenting, explaining and defending design work to internal and external stakeholders.
• Mentoring other designers in UI design best practice, as well as handling stakeholders.
• Managing and integrating stakeholder feedback, building relationships to enable a more collaborative way of working.
• Working with the larger design culture at Spotlight Sports Group to share design ideas and approaches for the purpose of creating a tighter overall product suite.
• Evangelising the benefits of good user centred design.

Requirements

Experience
• Working companies with complex digital products (e.g. in complex e-commerce or data rich digital products especially) in a predominantly client-side UX/UI design hybrid role or high-volume B2C/B2B role
• Designing for sport and/or betting a plus but not required
• Working with research, user personas and other methodologies to determine user needs to formulate hypotheses and wireframe / designs for digital products
• Collaborating with senior stakeholders from Product and Technology departments
• Working with other Designers and UX Researchers on a regular basis
• Evangelising the benefits of user experience for creating more customer focused, effective products and business outcomes
• Experience of influencing and advocating for the user/customer to non-design/digital design audiences, such as Product, Marketing or Technology Managers
• Designing for responsive web and one app platform (iOS or Android).
• Managing stakeholders across numerous departments.
• Working with UX Research and UX Design to help integrate findings, UX best practice and other user centric recommendations into compelling UI designs.
• Designing for accessibility within UI
• Designing a UI design system (or knowing how to work with them), creating visual style guides and knowledge around aligning designs with code component libraries is a massive plus

Skills and Knowledge:
• Must be able to execute at an accomplished level of design craft and organisation with minimal guidance by the Product Design Lead.
• Must be an exceptional communicator and collaborator who can balance business goals, user needs with excellent design solutions.
• Must be able to work collaboratively within a design team and with key stakeholders.
• Can support cross-functional team workflows.
• Can present and defend design work to non-design stakeholders in the business.
• Software skills:

• Knowledge of how to package up and hand-off finished designs for development.
• A solid foundational knowledge of UX methodologies and how to integrate user research into user experience design solutions.
• Possess a working knowledge of responsive web and app platforms - the opportunities and limitations of those platforms, especially around interaction design patterns and features that can affect performance.
• Possess an eye for typography, a good spatial sense for laying out screens and components, and knowledge of optimised colour usage for digital platforms.
• Be familiar and understand larger, familiar UI patterns for digital and how they define and affect interaction design.
• Be cognizant of what other departments (Marketing, Analytics, Product Research) do, what their goals are and how that can affect UI design output.
