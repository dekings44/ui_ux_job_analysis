Encord is a London-based startup building a comprehensive training data solution for computer vision AI applications. We are backed by CRV, Y Combinator Continuity, the Harvard Management Company, top industry executives, and other leading Bay Area investors.

Started by ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt firsthand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building practical AI. AI feels to us like what the early days of computing or the internet must have felt like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are terrible. We have devised a unique methodology for automating the tasks related to preparing quality training data, in effect turning the training data problem into a data science problem.

The Role

We are looking for an experienced UI/UX design engineer to help us build, design, and ship delightful and innovative products and features for modelling... creating, and managing training data for building AI applications. You will be collaborating closely with our customers to understand how they interact with our web-based UI’s, and how we can make them more intuitive and look prettier.

Qualifications

• Rapid prototyping of user interfaces using commonly used tools such as Figma, Photoshop, or similar

• A good understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion

• Experience building public facing websites that work elegantly across commonly used browsers

• Advanced knowledge of modern HTML and CSS

What We Offer

Encord offers a unique opportunity to be part of a startup with a clear mission and vision. You will get to explore and build services enterprise AI use cases across many different industry verticals such as healthcare, surveillance, retail, and agriculture.

Collaboration: as a fast growing small business we all work together across multiple workstreams. We have a flat structure and encourage frank discussion, honesty and openness.

Learning and development: the blockchain space is developing at an incredibly fast rate. Having a growth mentality and being open to continuous learning is an important part of our culture. It's always OK to not know the answer to something and have to do some research! We cement this by offering more formal perks to help fund employees' continued education.

Diversity and Inclusion: inclusiveness is one of our blockchain's core strengths, and in the same way we are committed to inclusiveness across all diversity dimensions. We are also actively looking for talent outside of the immediate blockchain space. What we primarily look for is general markers of excellence and ambition.

Mission driven: we believe that the Tezos blockchain is going to change the world and our goal is to promote its adoption. Blockchain technology will power new positive change, increase the democratisation of previously restricted systems and create transparency and trust",,"['7 days ago', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,7 days ago,Full-time,,2022-12-11 00:18:38.936093,ui ux designer,London,

I am working with one of London’s top design agencies and they are looking for a freelance Senior UX/ UI Designer (mostly UI Design).

They are looking for disruptive and powerful design, as its to design this agency’s own website, so think minimal, bold, colour, that kind of start-up vibe design. Imagine Monzo style of design (though this isn’t a corporate piece of work)

Here are the awesome things they are looking for:

· Experience with contemporary responsive web design

· Experience with emerging HTML5 animation and interactivity trends

· Ability to design striking responsive web pages with a narrative-to-scroll core

· Ability to design in a way that ensure easy back-end content updating (i.e. WP)

· Ability to design in a way that provides a smooth transition to dev (ie. using Figma)

· Understanding of SEO/social optimised design standards

· Understanding of A/AA optimised design standards

· Understanding of appropriate content treatment

The... even better news is that this is Outside IR35 and fully remote! Dream combo : )

If this is sounding just like you, drop me a note and let’s see where it takes us!

9,Mid-Level UI/UX Designer,SEGA,Anywhere,via Creativepool,"Sports Interactive (SI) is an ambitious development studio creating immersive sports management simulations. Since 1994, we’ve captivated a global audience of players with our iconic, BAFTA award-winning game, Football Manager. We’re a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEGA, having caught their attention in 2006 with our continuous critical and commercial success.

We’re a tenacious community, coming together at the Here East technology hub in Stratford, East London. Always expanding, the SI team takes on the gaming genre through a diverse array of disciplines. No matter how big we dream, though, we keep our approach (and your schedule) flexible, creating a relaxed atmosphere where collaboration can thrive.

Position Overview:

We are seeking a talented UI/UX Designer for our fast-growing Design team. Collaborating with the UI and Games Design teams you will be assisting in improvements being made to the overall UI of the product, with a specific focus on usability. This role offers the... chance to work on and develop for the world’s leading football management simulation titles. We are also aiming to improve our accessibility support to ensure our games are enjoyed by a wider range of audiences and would hope the successful applicant shares that passion.

The successful candidate will be organised, self-motivated and able to communicate with all disciplines, both within the design team and across the wider studio. You'll be keen to share your expertise and experience as well as committed to the constant improvement of your own skills and knowledge.

Please note: Due to the high volume of applications we receive any applications without a portfolio link showcasing your best work will be discounted.

Key Responsibilities:
• Collaborate with Games Design in developing new and exciting features for upcoming versions of Football Manager.
• Produce UI designs & assets of a consistently high quality.
• Communicate your work through Site Maps, User flows and early stage wireframing through to hi-res mock-ups.
• Work with the UI/UX Design Lead and Production to develop and grow your skillset.
• Within cross-disciplinary Feature Pods, collaborate with QA, Production, and other development disciplines to ensure all new features are placing the user and usability as a top priority.

Knowledge, Skill and Experience:
• Strong understanding of key UI design principles
• Ability to produce high quality, visually appealing UI assets
• Ability to communicate clearly and tell stories throughout the design process
• Experience with visual design software such as Figma and Miro
• A passion for UIUX design
• A yearning to understand and meet the needs of the user
• Ability to work collaboratively and as part of a close-knit team
• Clear written and verbal communication.

Desirable:
• Experience creating prototypes, wireframes and developing user flows
• 2+ years UI/UX professional experience within software production (ideally within the games industry but not exclusively)
• Experience in Unity
• Animation or motion design skills (e.g. After Effects, Principle etc.)
• Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS or similar
• Basic Understanding of Accessibility settings in games
• Experience of Adobe Suite (Illustrator/Photoshop)
• Interest in Football Manager and Football, whilst very helpful, is not essential

Working Here:

We approach everything with passion, whether that’s leaving our mark on the gaming and football industries or doing our bit for the world around us. We want to share that outlook with everyone who works here.

We like our talent to be tenacious, so you can expect to surround yourself with other ambitious individuals bringing their A-game to many different disciplines. We know collaboration is the key to consistent improvement and encourage our people to truly realise their own personal potential.

We believe everyone matters, no matter which part of the business you’re in. Above all else, we’re a team. A team with a down-to-earth dynamic that works and plays together. We have fun doing what we do and that’s one of the many reasons we’re one of the best places to work in the UK games business (Gameindustry 2021 Large studio category).

If you want a positive work/life balance, we’re right behind you. While we live to create extraordinary games, we know that’s not all you’ve got going on, so you can trust that we always keep things in perspective, fostering an environment where work can be more than just a job.

Our flexible working culture gives team members the responsibility to optimise their workloads, with in-office, hybrid, and remote working options. Even in countries where we don’t directly employ*, we’ll explore what’s possible via third parties and do our best to accommodate location preferences.

When you’re not here making the world’s best management games, there’s a top-class benefits package for permanent team members based in the UK including gym membership, private health, and dental care, plus many more perks. For permanent team members outside of the UK, we strive to offer equivalent and localised benefits. We’re also a London Living Wage employer and proudly boast one of the lowest staff turnover rates in the industry.
• We’re able to directly employ in the UK, Ireland, France, Sweden and Finland.

Inclusivity Matters:
We’re proud to be an equal opportunities employer and encourage applications from any relevant candidate irrespective of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, religion, or belief. Our studio has disabled access and facilities.

SI is proudly a Disability Confident Committed employer, and we are dedicated to ensuring our recruitment process is inclusive and accessible.

0,Senior UI/UX Designer,Builder.ai - What would you Build?,"London, UK",via Jobs By Workable,"About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build... run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

0,Lead UX/UI Designer,Avios,"London, UK",via IAG Loyalty Careers,"At IAG Loyalty (IAGL) we know that great user experience design is critical to fostering the long-term customer relationships that are core to our loyalty programmes. We have evolved as a product organisation over the last five years, with UX and UI design being done locally within product teams. We're now at a scale where we are ready for greater leadership across our design approach, to build a more coherent customer experience. We're looking for someone to take on this leadership role and step up the maturity of our UX/UI design model.

In this newly created role, as our Lead UX/UI Designer you'll relish the opportunity to write the rulebook on how we design at IAGL – specifically building our design system from the ground up. You'll enjoy the challenge of designing across four established airline brands, whilst bringing to life a unifying identity for loyalty that is relevant, inspiring and rewarding. You'll have the vision and influence to lead across multiple product teams in a... matrix organisation to achieve our design goals, working confidently with both contract and permanent design colleagues.

You'll enjoy the challenge of shaping this new role and playing a leadership role in the next phase of our growth. You'll have the opportunity to work across our wide-ranging product set, covering leading-edge technologies and touching partners in the airline, travel, finance and retail sectors.

How will I add value in this role?

You'll get under the skin of our user experience design today, identifying the assets, tools and ways of working in play, and how they ultimately come together to create our user experience. You'll set a strategy for world-class UX/UI design and provide the leadership to get us there.

You'll create IAG Loyalty's visual language by building a design system for use across cross-functional product teams, developing and designing products for our partner airlines (British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling). You'll drive adoption of the design system across our design and product community, working with teams to ensure a clear set of design standards are being met whilst actively utilising the input of our teams to continuously improve the system.

You'll always see the bigger picture and help build a holistic view of all the customer touchpoints, setting a strong foundation to build coherent and delightful customer experiences on. You'll also bring a fresh pair of eyes to the role, spotting opportunities to improve the way UX design is done at IAG Loyalty.

You'll act as a leader, coaching and supporting designers with design system adoption and ways of working. You'll implement best practices to bring our design community across IAGL together, as well as translating your design vision for audiences across the organisation.

You'll enjoy the visibility you'll have at all levels of our organisation, providing a ‘consulting' style approach to the way to you influence, shape and challenge our thinking.

What experience would you like me to have?

You'll be a senior UX/UI designer with experience across web and app channels, and with a range of design tools including Figma.

You'll have a strong track record in developing design systems that power brilliant and inclusive customer experiences. You'll be well versed in the design landscape with an understanding of how the best organisations are approaching design today.

You'll have the ability to embed yourself across the Product organisation and become the go-to for UX/UI leadership. Your communication skills will extend to both design and non-design audiences, to ensure the importance and strategy for design is understood by all. Your ability to manage stakeholders will be key to your success. You're able to influence without having direct control.

You'll have experience setting and leading UX/UI strategy and have the desire to go beyond the ‘doing' and into a functional leadership role.
