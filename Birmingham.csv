And to add to the (literal) wheelbarrow full of awards we’ve got including Euro Effies most effective global agency, Cannes Network of the Year, Campaign’s European Integrated Agency of the Year, not to mention McCann Central’s haul of awards in recent years at Cannes Lions, Clios, One Show, D&AD, LIAs, Golden Drum & Creative Circle Awards.

Permanent

I'm currently partnered with a web and software development agency based in Crewe who are looking for a Creative Designer to join their team.

The Role
You will design the UI/UX on a variety of digital solutions for our clients including brochure websites, e-commerce platforms, online portals, and software applications. You will take ownership of the entire design process, from helping to collect insights from the client, to designing the UI/UX, reviewing concepts with the client, and handing over to the front-end development team. There may also be opportunity to work on several branding and print design projects (subject to experience).

More specifically, you will:
• Gather insights from the client and develop a thorough understanding of their business (market position, products/services), and users (demographics, psychographics, behavioural) to inform design decisions.
• Design UI/UX concepts for entire systems - driven by insights.
• Present... concepts to clients via screenshare calls, discuss the concepts, and provide rationale behind key design decisions.
• Design responsive views for concepts.
• Iterate design concepts until we reach final concept, working in a collaborative way with project stakeholders throughout the Design phase.
• Liaise with the Technical Lead to ensure that design concepts meet client briefs and functional requirements.
• Hand over designs to the front-end development team for front-end implementation and provide guidance to front-end developers when required.
• Provide updates to Project Support on the progress of Design concepts, identify and communicate any potential blockers.
• Proactively engage with the latest trends in Design and share ideas with the Head of Design.

You
• You will have experience in creating brilliant conceptual web design.
• On a personal level, a creative mind is key, and you must possess a perfectionist approach to detail. A calm and collected character is important as this is a fast-paced environment with several ongoing projects, all of which are time-sensitive.
• Finally, communication skills are critical as you will be working closely with several stakeholders (internal and external). A key component of this role is to effectively gather design requirements from clients, and present your concepts accordingly (via screenshare or face-to-face).
• Ideally, you will have experience as a UX/UI Designer in a similar role, preferably within an agency.

• Experience designing UX on at least one title
• Experience managing a small team through all phases of the project lifecycle
• Portfolio showing experience designing high fidelity UI using industry standard tools, e.g., Adobe XD, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, etc

AND Introduction

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

About You

As a UI/UX Designer, you will help to deliver world class customer experiences for our clients, guiding them... on best practice in visual design, user experience and design development, as well as delivering design outputs of your own.
• This is a client facing delivery role with a mix of advising, implementing and delivering, sometimes across multiple clients
• You will be an ambassador on user experience and visual design, supporting the creative direction and vision within our fast growing design function.
• You’ll engage closely with the client and Scrum teams to review current design processes and methods, before making your recommendation and making it happen!
• You’ll also have the chance to shape and deliver internal communication and training
• Support the development of design skills in the Club

To do that, it’s essential you bring the following:
• 4+ years of UI design experience
• Experience in Mobile, web and responsive environments
• Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
• The ability to work both independently and as part of a team
• Strong visual and brainstorming skills with the ability to confidently sketch interfaces in cross functional collaborative teams
• Experience with design systems, from creation to management over time

It’s helpful if you also have:
• Interest or experience in UX research
• Knowledge of Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, Marvel, Invision, Figma
• Demonstrable experience delivering B2B and B2C UX and/or UI for dashboard, control panels and management applications
• Demonstrable experience delivering innovative solutions for consumer facing iOS and Android applications, utilising native functionality where appropriate
• Ability to flex between UX and UI if required is a plus

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
• We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
• There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
• Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.

5,UX designer at a data start-up,Anmut,"England, UK",via AngelList,"About Anmut

In 2018, Anmut was started to solve a big problem. We saw the world-changing potential of data being lost because most organisations don’t understand the real value of it. So we set up Anmut to value data. We translate the intangible idea of data into an asset that businesses can better manage, earning higher returns on their data investments and ultimately driving more change. We democratise the value of data, for all those businesses that aren’t Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix or Microsoft.

Data valuation is a new and challenging field, and we’re at the forefront. Our approach isn’t limited to shareholder value. We also take a broader, more considered view, applying strategic thinking, data science and machine learning to understand the role data plays in the value an organisation creates for its wider stakeholders.

We are building an exceptional team to deliver a suite of innovative software products to support our mission and our clients. As data is intangible... developing products that help bring to life its value and importance in a visually interactive way is an exciting opportunity we need your help with. If you want to be part of a creative and growing business, tackling a complex challenge that matters, read on.

Role

We are looking for a UX designer to join our small, high-energy product team. You will be critical to defining the user experience of our new products by:
• Taking the lead on the UX development aspect of our new products. We have lots of ambitious and exciting ideas and this is an opportunity to really own the UX design aspect of something completely new.
• Gathering requirements from a range of different stakeholders and translating them into user journeys, storyboards and initial design ideas.
• Designing the appropriate flow and layout of solutions which optimise the experience for the user.
• Building visually appealing wireframes and prototypes to bring complex ideas around understanding data to life.
• Think critically about design from the user’s perspective, to design and iterate the most elegant solution possible and help identify likely user issues early.
• Gathering feedback on designs from a wider range of stakeholders
• Working alongside our developers to help convert final designs into software.
• What we look for
• Ability to translate complex customer requirements into user journeys, wireframes and prototypes to demonstrate best practice user experience.
• A strong visual design aesthetic including high quality UI, along with a keen eye for detail.
• Experience in prototyping including proficiency in industry standard design software (e.g. Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision, Figma etc).
• Ability to draw out critical requirements, and identify and predict potential design problems early.
• Strong communication skills and ability to interact clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across the wider business.
• A commitment to the highest quality standards, with designs being clear enough for easy hand off to developers.
• A willingness to seek out feedback and constructive criticism on work produced.
• A pragmatic and flexible attitude – recognition that lack of clarity can be inherent in designing something so new, as well as consideration for technical constraints placed on designs.
• A creative and innovative mind that is not afraid to offer different ideas that are ‘outside the box’
• A real passion to create something that is completely new.

Additional desirable experience
• A degree (preferably in a discipline relevant to Art, Design or Usability), professional certification to a similar level or related work experience
• Experience working within Agile / Sprint based environments
• Experience in designing products from initial design through to hand-off to the development team for build.
• Experience in delivering designs which reflect complex user requirements and deliver measurable business benefits.
• Experience in working in a related field to data management or experience of data management tools e.g. Tableau, PowerBI, Collibra
• Knowledge or experience of the technology behind web development e.g. CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

We are looking to shape this role based on finding the right person with a passion to grow with us as a company, and therefore the exact role requirements are flexible based on your previous level of experience. If you do not exactly meet our requirements but feel that you would be a good fit for the role, please apply anyway! Every application is reviewed by our team and we're always looking to evolve our understanding of what a great candidate looks like.

Benefits
• Salary: £TBC based on experience, plus annual bonus. Bi-annual salary reviews.
• Opportunity for equity with career development.
• 25 days annual leave.
• Monthly development reviews.
• Training and development budget for professional development.
• Social events.

Volume 3 was created to mark the studio’s 10th anniversary, and was displayed and sold at the Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle, where we held the exhibition Other Worlds: The Art of Atomhawk in 2020. You can take a virtual tour of the exhibition here.

We want you to #JOINTHEREBELLION!

For 30 years we’ve been creating incredible video games at our multiple studios, but Rebellion is more than just games. We have our own film and mo-cap studio, we create board games, publish books, and through 2000AD, publish comics and graphic novels such as the amazing Judge Dredd.

We operate across multiple UK locations, with studios based in Oxford, Warwick, Liverpool, and Wakefield.

• Drive the delivery and quality of the UI for the project, mentoring and supporting UI designers, artists, and technical designers

Requirements
• Experience designing UX on at least one title
• Experience managing a small team through all phases of the project lifecycle
• Portfolio showing experience designing high fidelity UI using industry standard tools, e.g., Adobe XD, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, etc
• Able to effectively communicate whilst building long-term, trusting relationships with a wide range of people
• Games as a service experience required for this project

Benefits

We offer an extensive benefits package to our team including:
• 26 days holiday + Bank holidays (increasing with service at 5 years – one day each year until you reach 31 days)

ABOUT OPENCELL.BIO

Our mission is to bring down the barriers to entry of biotechnology. We want to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to build with biology.

We are based in White City London, at the heart of the biotech revolution. Over the last 3 years, the team has bootstrapped a we-work for biotech that gives startups access to hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of equipment for hundreds of pounds a month. We have built and deployed rapid-response diagnostic labs and processed half a million COVID qPCR tests. We are looking for outstanding product-obsessed people to join our team to help us build the best labs in the world.

WHERE YOU WILL WORK

You will work in the first “BioHotel” which will bring over 12000 sqft of lab space to West London.

The BioHotel is a new model for flexible and fully serviced lab-space for life science companies.

BioHotel laboratories are connected to a virtual twin to plan experiments, book and collect data from equipment, and monitors the ideal conditions such as airflow, temperature and humidity from home or the office. The labs have reproducibility and regulations at its heart to move enable companies to move fast and seamless from R&D to trials to production.

Besides private labs, the BioHotel facilities provide access to equipment worth 100,000 GBP for a few pounds per day. Its support services such as (cold) deliveries, clinical waste, H&S and integrated consumables store allow companies to focus on development of their technology instead of investing time and money into their infrastructure.

It is the perfect place for companies if they need to access equipment for a day to run a PCR, for a month to run a trial, or longer to bring an idea into reality.

We all LOVE biotechnology and are excited about sharing what we do. You must LOVE it too. You need to be driven and have a passion to create products, not just ideas. You need to be brave and prepared to test your assumptions rapidly, take criticism, and start over from scratch. You need an open mind but also an intense focus on product delivery. You need to be excited to work within a collaborative diverse team. We love research but we are not looking for researchers without a product mindset.

OpenCell.bio focuses on Biotechnology. Their company has offices in London. They have a small team that's between 11-50 employees.

4,Senior UX Designer,Sweep,Anywhere,via AngelList,"We’re hiring a Senior UX Designer, tasked to make Sweep an outstanding experience for our users, and a real driver of change for our planet.

Ideally you’re based in London, but if we fall in love with you, Europe and beyond might work just fine as well.

Sweep builds software that lets businesses take control of their climate journey - from managing and reducing emissions, to championing cutting edge climate projects.

I’m intrigued. What would I be doing?

You will have a key role in developing the Sweep user experience. Together with the team, you will turn complex sustainability standards, data sets and interactions into interfaces that are easy to understand and a joy to navigate.

You will be seeing projects through from start to finish, working in close collaboration with our product, engineering and... carbon staff.

This position will allow you to shape our design approach from the ground up, planting the seeds for many good things to come.

Nice. Can you be a bit more specific please?

In your day to day, you will...

1. Design software for a better future 🎨
• Help steer our product design from crucial big architectural strokes down to the smallest interaction that makes all the difference.
• Kick off the design process through exploration, ideation and user validation.
• Design interaction models, wireframes and prototypes that focus on ease of use and optimise how customers interact with our software.
• Present design solutions, defend design decisions and incorporate feedback into the design cycle.

2. Build the Sweep design system ⚙️
• Ensure a consistent brand and UI experience across the whole customer journey.
• Maintain a unified, scalable and progressive design system through libraries and documentation.
• Make sure that we build accessibility into our product right from the start.

3. Establish our user research practice 🔬
• Organise and host design critiques and user research labs.
• Gather and document insights that will influence our UX, feature development and roadmaps.
• Help establish best practices for user research at Sweep.

4. Be an advocate for good design 🎙
• Actively develop a positive, productive and passionate design culture within Sweep.
• Represent our mission externally, through active exchange with the design industry, to help build Sweep’s network and thought leadership credentials.

That sounds just right for me. What do I need to bring?

Good you asked. This is who we’re looking for:

Qualifications 🏆
• You bring a minimum of 5 years of experience in software product design
• Experience in software-as-a-service environments, ideally in the B2B space
• Proven expertise turning complex business problems into simple and engaging products
• Strong command of interaction design, visual design and information architecture
• Experience working closely with multi-disciplinary teams
• Adept at communicating and prototyping interactions rapidly at all levels of resolution
• A deep knowledge of modern web UI patterns

Qualities 🧠
• You’re an empathetic team player that is great at building lasting relationships
• A strategic thinker, who sees both the big picture and the smaller underlying mechanics
• An expert English language communicator that has a knack for breaking down complex topics both verbally and written. Also, French is an added bonus
• A hands-on problem solver, self-motivated with a glass half-full attitude
• An entrepreneurial mind, ready to launch and fail and iterate
• Attuned to remote collaboration, using digital tools and meticulously documenting work
• A desire and ambition to grow, mentor and support other designers on the team

Ok, sounds fun. What’s in it for me?

You will be joining an exciting young business that has the humble ambition to change the world. With a proven track record in starting companies, we’re planning to hit the ground running and have an impact fast. Joining this journey right at the beginning allows you to really help shape our path.

You will join a dynamic (mostly remote) team of engineers, business minds, creatives and carbon experts spread across France and the UK. We’re a fun bunch of people that want to work hard, and enjoy ourselves while doing so. And we believe in creating a calm environment, that knows that life is not just work, and we’ll be doing better work because of that.

We’re big believers in creating successful businesses that are good for everyone, including society and the planet. That’s why we have a BCorp Startup status.

We think this might be the ride of our lives. And maybe yours, too.

8,Lead UI Designer,Builder.ai,"England, UK",via AngelList,"About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build... run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

You’ll have led projects in the past and may have run your own design team. You’ll be able to help steer direction and take the front foot on the path a project takes as well as provide the documentation to support this.

The right tools

Client facing

You should have experience of dealing with clients and internal stakeholders and be able to expertly communicate with the teams you collaborate with. You’ll likely be familiar with running workshops and will know how to present design effectively and manage feedback.

🎯 Our Values

We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back’, because it’s the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Yes first - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it’s no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don’t tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

At this point we can only support Visas from the EU or accept people with work permits in the UK.

Please make sure to answer the following questions in the application:
• Why do you want to work at Sequel as compared to any other company?
• Please share links or screenshots of products you have worked on, and describe which parts you were responsible for.
