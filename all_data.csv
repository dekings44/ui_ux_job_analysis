• Fully remote US based candidates will also be considered
• This is a hybrid role (remote and Bristol office, for UK candidates) - You will also need to come into the London office at least once a month (subsidised)

Spotlight Sports Group is a global media and technology company specialising in sports betting content and data. We have over 500 staff, and operate multiple award-winning B2C brands including Racing Post, MyRacing, Soccerbase & Free Super Tips in the UK. In the US we operate Pickswise & Fantasy Alarm. Our other businesses in the group are ICS-digital and ICS-translate. Our global B2B division provides sports betting and fantasy sports content, media partnerships (including a joint venture with Spanish publisher, AS) & much more.

The Product Design and Research team are a key element of the business transformation to digital and the future success of Spotlight Sports Group. We are driven to provide timely, authoritative content and... experiences so sports enthusiasts can be deeply informed and inspired and bettors can bet with confidence and ease. This role would be working with our Sports Affiliate team, mainly working on our US brand - Pickswise, helping to bring premium sports data and content for NFL, basketball, baseball, hockey and more, to sport enthusiasts and sports bettors alike. We have first generation products out in the US and UK/Europe; we’re looking for someone to help us take these products to the next level of audience engagement as we provide more content, tools and data to our users.

We’re looking for a Senior Product Designer to work on our Pickswise brand - our flagship sports product for the US market. You would also work on some emerging brands for other markets including Latin America and Asia, as they come online. If you like working in (or want to work in) sport, working with data visualisation, solving complex business problems involving a hefty amount of data, insight, and sports analysis (because you like geeking out) with a highly collaborative team designing products that are pushing into new markets across the world, this could be the role you’re looking for.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is a mid level or recently became senior who wants to build up their experience - learning, progressing and contributing to a larger design approach. You’ll have the opportunity to influence stakeholders across the business and mentor more junior designers, while being given the room to develop and push your craft.

The role:
• This role is a senior level hybrid role of UX and UI disciplines, more heavily weighted towards User Interface Design - we need someone who has deep UI knowledge and interaction design experience.
• A good candidate for this role is someone who enjoys collaboration and bringing both designers and stakeholders on a journey to creating the best user centred product.
• This role will include mentoring other mid level designers - thus it would suit someone looking to move to the next phase of their career.
• Having enthusiasm for sport will be a huge benefit for this role. Any knowledge of US sports like NFL, basketball, baseball, hockey, etc. is a very big plus.

Aspects of this role include:
• Working with product owners, researchers and other designers on the team to identify and define usability issues and opportunities within our digital product suite of sport affiliate websites and apps
• Collaborating with User Research to understand current users and users in growth markets both in Europe and internationally (e.g. the US).
• Running / owning larger pieces of work, including working with other designers to distribute work and ensure high quality levels are maintained throughout the projects.
• Working closely with the Product Design Manager to help improve ways or working, identify areas for optimisation and encourage exploration into areas ripe for innovation.
• Designing, prototyping and building digital product designs for larger flows and smaller features for responsive websites and mobile apps.
• Prepping screens and prototypes for user testing (both lab and/or remote testing)
• Working closely with development in a modified Agile environment to ensure solutions are technically feasible, as well as being involved in design handover and UAT processes.
• Presenting, explaining and defending design work to internal and external stakeholders.
• Mentoring other designers in UI design best practice, as well as handling stakeholders.
• Managing and integrating stakeholder feedback, building relationships to enable a more collaborative way of working.
• Working with the larger design culture at Spotlight Sports Group to share design ideas and approaches for the purpose of creating a tighter overall product suite.
• Evangelising the benefits of good user centred design.

Requirements

Experience
• Working companies with complex digital products (e.g. in complex e-commerce or data rich digital products especially) in a predominantly client-side UX/UI design hybrid role or high-volume B2C/B2B role
• Designing for sport and/or betting a plus but not required
• Working with research, user personas and other methodologies to determine user needs to formulate hypotheses and wireframe / designs for digital products
• Collaborating with senior stakeholders from Product and Technology departments
• Working with other Designers and UX Researchers on a regular basis
• Evangelising the benefits of user experience for creating more customer focused, effective products and business outcomes
• Experience of influencing and advocating for the user/customer to non-design/digital design audiences, such as Product, Marketing or Technology Managers
• Designing for responsive web and one app platform (iOS or Android).
• Managing stakeholders across numerous departments.
• Working with UX Research and UX Design to help integrate findings, UX best practice and other user centric recommendations into compelling UI designs.
• Designing for accessibility within UI
• Designing a UI design system (or knowing how to work with them), creating visual style guides and knowledge around aligning designs with code component libraries is a massive plus

Skills and Knowledge:
• Must be able to execute at an accomplished level of design craft and organisation with minimal guidance by the Product Design Lead.
• Must be an exceptional communicator and collaborator who can balance business goals, user needs with excellent design solutions.
• Must be able to work collaboratively within a design team and with key stakeholders.

• Possess an eye for typography, a good spatial sense for laying out screens and components, and knowledge of optimised colour usage for digital platforms.
• Be familiar and understand larger, familiar UI patterns for digital and how they define and affect interaction design.

We offer careers that provide endless opportunity – helping millions of individuals and businesses thrive and creating financial and digital solutions that the world now takes for granted.

We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home... and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve.

Who we are

McCann Milton Keynes is part of McCann Worldgroup, a global agency network that delivers culture-shaping work for some of the world’s biggest brands.

And to add to the (literal) wheelbarrow full of awards we’ve got including Euro Effies most effective global agency, Cannes Network of the Year, Campaign’s European Integrated Agency of the Year, not to mention McCann Central’s haul of awards in recent years at Cannes Lions, Clios, One Show, D&AD, LIAs, Golden Drum & Creative Circle Awards.

• Create inspirational digital concept ideas and designs that help bring brands and user journeys to life in engaging and effective methods.
• Be the lead digital storyteller – using your skills to help create designs that can communicate key brand messages, value propositions and guide users on emotional and functional journeys as required.

Our commitment to equal opportunities

For us, diversity is a business imperative – one that must be embedded into every aspect of how we operate in order to drive success. Simply put, we believe an encouraging and inclusive environment makes sound business sense.

As a globally integrated community that influences and shapes culture, it’s vital that the talent mix in our agencies encompasses all dimensions of diversity, and that we demand the same of the people we work with.

Conscious inclusion encompasses social, cultural and cognitive differences and cultivates an ethos of belonging, connection and shared purpose. It is the integration of this philosophy that allows us to create meaningful experiences for our employees, drive better business practices with our vendors and clients, and ultimately lead with purpose.

I'm currently partnered with a web and software development agency based in Crewe who are looking for a Creative Designer to join their team.

The Role
You will design the UI/UX on a variety of digital solutions for our clients including brochure websites, e-commerce platforms, online portals, and software applications. You will take ownership of the entire design process, from helping to collect insights from the client, to designing the UI/UX, reviewing concepts with the client, and handing over to the front-end development team. There may also be opportunity to work on several branding and print design projects (subject to experience).

More specifically, you will:
• Gather insights from the client and develop a thorough understanding of their business (market position, products/services), and users (demographics, psychographics, behavioural) to inform design decisions.
• Design UI/UX concepts for entire systems - driven by insights.
• Present... concepts to clients via screenshare calls, discuss the concepts, and provide rationale behind key design decisions.
• Design responsive views for concepts.
• Iterate design concepts until we reach final concept, working in a collaborative way with project stakeholders throughout the Design phase.
• Liaise with the Technical Lead to ensure that design concepts meet client briefs and functional requirements.
• Hand over designs to the front-end development team for front-end implementation and provide guidance to front-end developers when required.
• Provide updates to Project Support on the progress of Design concepts, identify and communicate any potential blockers.
• Proactively engage with the latest trends in Design and share ideas with the Head of Design.

You
• You will have experience in creating brilliant conceptual web design.
• On a personal level, a creative mind is key, and you must possess a perfectionist approach to detail. A calm and collected character is important as this is a fast-paced environment with several ongoing projects, all of which are time-sensitive.
• Finally, communication skills are critical as you will be working closely with several stakeholders (internal and external). A key component of this role is to effectively gather design requirements from clients, and present your concepts accordingly (via screenshare or face-to-face).
• Ideally, you will have experience as a UX/UI Designer in a similar role, preferably within an agency.

• Experience designing UX on at least one title
• Experience managing a small team through all phases of the project lifecycle
• Portfolio showing experience designing high fidelity UI using industry standard tools, e.g., Adobe XD, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, etc
• Able to effectively communicate whilst building long-term, trusting relationships with a wide range of people

AND Introduction

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

About You

As a UI/UX Designer, you will help to deliver world class customer experiences for our clients, guiding them... on best practice in visual design, user experience and design development, as well as delivering design outputs of your own.
• This is a client facing delivery role with a mix of advising, implementing and delivering, sometimes across multiple clients
• You will be an ambassador on user experience and visual design, supporting the creative direction and vision within our fast growing design function.
• You’ll engage closely with the client and Scrum teams to review current design processes and methods, before making your recommendation and making it happen!
• You’ll also have the chance to shape and deliver internal communication and training
• Support the development of design skills in the Club

To do that, it’s essential you bring the following:
• 4+ years of UI design experience
• Experience in Mobile, web and responsive environments
• Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
• The ability to work both independently and as part of a team
• Strong visual and brainstorming skills with the ability to confidently sketch interfaces in cross functional collaborative teams
• Experience with design systems, from creation to management over time

It’s helpful if you also have:
• Interest or experience in UX research
• Knowledge of Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, Marvel, Invision, Figma
• Demonstrable experience delivering B2B and B2C UX and/or UI for dashboard, control panels and management applications
• Demonstrable experience delivering innovative solutions for consumer facing iOS and Android applications, utilising native functionality where appropriate
• Ability to flex between UX and UI if required is a plus

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
• We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
• There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
• Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.

105,5,UX designer at a data start-up,Anmut,"England, UK",via AngelList,"About Anmut

In 2018, Anmut was started to solve a big problem. We saw the world-changing potential of data being lost because most organisations don’t understand the real value of it. So we set up Anmut to value data. We translate the intangible idea of data into an asset that businesses can better manage, earning higher returns on their data investments and ultimately driving more change. We democratise the value of data, for all those businesses that aren’t Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix or Microsoft.

Data valuation is a new and challenging field, and we’re at the forefront. Our approach isn’t limited to shareholder value. We also take a broader, more considered view, applying strategic thinking, data science and machine learning to understand the role data plays in the value an organisation creates for its wider stakeholders.

We are building an exceptional team to deliver a suite of innovative software products to support our mission and our clients. As data is intangible... developing products that help bring to life its value and importance in a visually interactive way is an exciting opportunity we need your help with. If you want to be part of a creative and growing business, tackling a complex challenge that matters, read on.

Role

We are looking for a UX designer to join our small, high-energy product team. You will be critical to defining the user experience of our new products by:
• Taking the lead on the UX development aspect of our new products. We have lots of ambitious and exciting ideas and this is an opportunity to really own the UX design aspect of something completely new.
• Gathering requirements from a range of different stakeholders and translating them into user journeys, storyboards and initial design ideas.
• Designing the appropriate flow and layout of solutions which optimise the experience for the user.
• Building visually appealing wireframes and prototypes to bring complex ideas around understanding data to life.
• Think critically about design from the user’s perspective, to design and iterate the most elegant solution possible and help identify likely user issues early.
• Gathering feedback on designs from a wider range of stakeholders
• Working alongside our developers to help convert final designs into software.
• What we look for
• Ability to translate complex customer requirements into user journeys, wireframes and prototypes to demonstrate best practice user experience.
• A strong visual design aesthetic including high quality UI, along with a keen eye for detail.
• Experience in prototyping including proficiency in industry standard design software (e.g. Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision, Figma etc).
• Ability to draw out critical requirements, and identify and predict potential design problems early.
• Strong communication skills and ability to interact clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across the wider business.
• A commitment to the highest quality standards, with designs being clear enough for easy hand off to developers.
• A willingness to seek out feedback and constructive criticism on work produced.
• A pragmatic and flexible attitude – recognition that lack of clarity can be inherent in designing something so new, as well as consideration for technical constraints placed on designs.
• A creative and innovative mind that is not afraid to offer different ideas that are ‘outside the box’
• A real passion to create something that is completely new.

Additional desirable experience
• A degree (preferably in a discipline relevant to Art, Design or Usability), professional certification to a similar level or related work experience
• Experience working within Agile / Sprint based environments
• Experience in designing products from initial design through to hand-off to the development team for build.
• Experience in delivering designs which reflect complex user requirements and deliver measurable business benefits.
• Experience in working in a related field to data management or experience of data management tools e.g. Tableau, PowerBI, Collibra
• Knowledge or experience of the technology behind web development e.g. CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

We are looking to shape this role based on finding the right person with a passion to grow with us as a company, and therefore the exact role requirements are flexible based on your previous level of experience. If you do not exactly meet our requirements but feel that you would be a good fit for the role, please apply anyway! Every application is reviewed by our team and we're always looking to evolve our understanding of what a great candidate looks like.

Benefits
• Salary: £TBC based on experience, plus annual bonus. Bi-annual salary reviews.
• Opportunity for equity with career development.
• 25 days annual leave.
• Monthly development reviews.
• Training and development budget for professional development.
• Social events.

You can take a virtual tour of the exhibition here.

We want you to #JOINTHEREBELLION!

For 30 years we’ve been creating incredible video games at our multiple studios, but Rebellion is more than just games. We have our own film and mo-cap studio, we create board games, publish books, and through 2000AD, publish comics and graphic novels such as the amazing Judge Dredd.

We operate across multiple UK locations, with studios based in Oxford, Warwick, Liverpool, and Wakefield.

Requirements
• Experience designing UX on at least one title
• Experience managing a small team through all phases of the project lifecycle
• Portfolio showing experience designing high fidelity UI using industry standard tools, e.g., Adobe XD, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, etc

• Games as a service experience required for this project

Benefits

ABOUT OPENCELL.BIO

Our mission is to bring down the barriers to entry of biotechnology. We want to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to build with biology.

We are based in White City London, at the heart of the biotech revolution. Over the last 3 years, the team has bootstrapped a we-work for biotech that gives startups access to hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of equipment for hundreds of pounds a month. We have built and deployed rapid-response diagnostic labs and processed half a million COVID qPCR tests. We are looking for outstanding product-obsessed people to join our team to help us build the best labs in the world.

WHERE YOU WILL WORK

You will work in the first “BioHotel” which will bring over 12000 sqft of lab space to West London.

The BioHotel is a new model for flexible and fully serviced lab-space for life science companies.

BioHotel laboratories are connected to a virtual twin to plan experiments, book and collect data from equipment, and monitors the ideal conditions such as airflow, temperature and humidity from home or the office. The labs have reproducibility and regulations at its heart to move enable companies to move fast and seamless from R&D to trials to production.

Besides private labs, the BioHotel facilities provide access to equipment worth 100,000 GBP for a few pounds per day. Its support services such as (cold) deliveries, clinical waste, H&S and integrated consumables store allow companies to focus on development of their technology instead of investing time and money into their infrastructure.

It is the perfect place for companies if they need to access equipment for a day to run a PCR, for a month to run a trial, or longer to bring an idea into reality.

We all LOVE biotechnology and are excited about sharing what we do. You must LOVE it too. You need to be driven and have a passion to create products, not just ideas. You need to be brave and prepared to test your assumptions rapidly, take criticism, and start over from scratch. You need an open mind but also an intense focus on product delivery. You need to be excited to work within a collaborative diverse team. We love research but we are not looking for researchers without a product mindset.

OpenCell.bio focuses on Biotechnology. Their company has offices in London. They have a small team that's between 11-50 employees.

168,8,Lead UI Designer,Builder.ai,"England, UK",via AngelList,"About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build... run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

🎯 Our Values

We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back’, because it’s the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Yes first - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it’s no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don’t tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

At this point we can only support Visas from the EU or accept people with work permits in the UK.

Please make sure to answer the following questions in the application:
• Why do you want to work at Sequel as compared to any other company?
• Please share links or screenshots of products you have worked on, and describe which parts you were responsible for.

Due to their success, they're looking to expand their team and as part of that are looking to enhance the UX/UI Design skills within the team.

The company already work with multi-national clients across many different industries, but their clientele is expanding all the time. Having been around for over 20 years now, they are globally known as the market leaders within their field!

What will I be doing?

Great question!

The company are also looking to re-develop and improve their award-winning platform and are working with a range of modern tech to ensure they stay ahead of their competition within the market!

You'll obviously work very closely with your design team and will report into the Head of Product. They have dedicated research experts, so you'll focus more on the design side of things but will still be expected to appreciate understand the importance of research... as well.

One of the best things about this role and company, is that you'll be working on a product that generally matters. It's a product that improves people's working environments across the world and you will play a massive part in improving the user experience of the product!

Who am I?

Ideally, you'll have experience working as a Digital Product/UX/UI Designer. This role will be key in re-shaping how the product is used by the company's customers so would suit someone that is motivated to make an impact in an already-successful business!

You should be someone that can take findings from research and transform these into attractive designs that are in-line with the research analysis. The company are in the process of building their internal Design System, so any experience of this would be ideal. Experience designing on a SaaS platform would be very beneficial as well.

In terms of personality, the team are super outgoing and collaborative, so they are looking for a similar personality. The team work really closely together, so you'll have a great support network and other passionate Designers to bounce ideas off of. You'll be dealing with different stakeholders so experience of this would be great but it's not essential as they can offer lots of training on how to improve these skills. The main thing that they're looking for is someone that is fanatical about their craft, if this is you then you'll fit right in!

What are the benefits and where will I be based?

This is probably worth knowing before applying. The salary range for the role is 40,000 - 55,000 which is dependent on experience.

The company have an office in Glasgow, but the team pretty much works fully remote. You might be asked to meet up with the team every now and then, but this is by no means essential. If you do prefer to work in an office, then they're more than happy for you to do so!

Permanent, Home Based

Are you a UI / UX designer with experience using Adobe Creative Suite who enjoys creating and coding front end interfaces?

As a UI / UX Designer here at Netcall, you’ll predominantly be creating front end interfaces for our low code software platform, Liberty Create. Create is awesome and extremely versatile, it enables our customers to build custom applications quickly and easily to automate tasks, saving time and improving their customers’ experience…without the need to be a software developer!

You’re highly adept using Adobe Creative Suite, you’ll be creating and coding webpages for our clients, they’ll need to look great, be highly functional and really easy to use.

You’ll need to gather the requirements of the customer to get an idea of what they want their pages to look like and how they want them to function. You’ll then build a prototype page in Adobe to get the right look and feel for the layout, incorporating logos, graphics, text... and buttons on the different screens.

You’ll ideally have worked on a broad range of projects for different customers, perhaps you have worked for a web development agency managing multiple client projects which present different challenges which you need to adapt to.

You enjoy coming up with solutions to challenging design tasks, there’s plenty to get your teeth into here! There’s loads of opportunity to get your creative juices flowing – we’re always looking for new ideas and innovative ways of solving problems.

Why should you join Netcall?

· Reward – we are offering a competitive package, plus a whole host of other benefits from pension to Perkbox.

· Flexible working – we moved to remote working during the pandemic and it is working brilliantly, we also have offices in Bedford and Poole if you want a change of scenery.

· We are problem solvers – our software solves real-world problems, whether it’s automating laborious processes, via our suite of Low-code, AI and RPA technologies or centralising communication through call centre conversational messaging capability. What we call the Liberty Intelligent Automation platform.

· We are always learning – the day job is very important, but it’s also great to learn new things and we encourage our colleagues to grow. Our Academy is accessible not only to our staff but to all our customers and partners.

About You

Well versed in the use of Adobe Creative Suite.

Experienced in UI and UX design on a wide range of projects, it would be great if you had previously worked for a web development agency on multiple client projects.

Ideally some experience designing webpages for a SaaS platform / product.

You take ownership over your projects, but also enjoy sharing ideas with the team to gain collective input and problem solving.

You may have some knowledge of Vue.JS and Bulma CSS framework, though not essential.

Due to the nature of the role, you are expected to gain and maintain Non-Police Personnel Vetting Level 3 (NPPV3) clearance and therefore it is essential that you have held continuous residency in the UK for the past 3 years.

Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances

241,5,User Interface Designer,Cathcart Technology,Anywhere,via Check-A-Salary,"A disruptive start-up in Glasgow is looking for a UI Designer to join the team. The company have identified an opportunity in a monopoly market that they believe they can shake up with new, end-to-end software and have managed to secure backing for this already.

They’ve started to bring together a highly-skilled team to begin the build of this new software after having extremely positive feedback through successful talks of their beta product.

Ideally, you’ll have experience of working across end-to-end design and experience of working across B2B products. If not, experience building customer facing applications would work fine too. There isn’t lots and lots of research to be done within the role as the founders of the company have continuously been doing research over the last year, so the role will be more focused on UX & UI Design. They've recently brought in a UX Designer to the team and are now looking for someone that is more focused on UI & Visual Design that will complement... the team.

The software that the company will be building involves 3D elements, so you’ll work very closely with the 3D/Visual expert as well as the CTO, Developers and founders of the company.

They aren’t looking for someone that has years and years of experience, as long as you’ve got experience across at least one product, that is fine with them. If you are super experienced, they are happy to consider you as well, but they do have a slight preference for someone a bit rougher around the edges.

The company is based in Glasgow, but they can offer fully remote working – there will be on-site meetings every now and then so they’re ideally looking for someone to at least be based in Scotland.

Salary for the role is up to £45,000 but they could potentially go above this for someone that is perfect.

If you’re a Designer that wants to work for a disruptive start-up, then please apply and/or get in touch with Jack Steven at Cathcart Technology",,"['4 days ago', 'Work from home', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,4 days ago,Full-time,,True,2022-12-11 00:25:04.642083,ui ux designer,Glasgow,

Autonomy: we believe in hiring great people, then giving them the space and flexibility to work in the way that’s best for them. We will agree on goals, and then expect you to decide how you want to pursue those goals.
Collaboration: as a fast growing small business we all work together across multiple workstreams. We have a flat structure and encourage frank discussion, honesty and openness.
Learning and development: the blockchain space is developing at an incredibly fast rate. Having a growth mentality and being open to continuous learning is an important part of our culture. It’s always OK to not know the answer to something and have to do some research! We cement this by offering more formal perks to help fund employees’ continued education.
Diversity and Inclusion: inclusiveness is one of our blockchain’s core strengths, and in the same way we are committed to inclusiveness across all diversity dimensions. We are also actively looking for talent outside of the immediate blockchain space. What we primarily look for is general markers of excellence and ambition.
Mission driven: we believe that the Tezos blockchain is going to change the world and our goal is to promote its adoption. Blockchain technology will power new positive change, increase the democratisation of previously restricted systems and create transparency and trust",,"['3 days ago', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,3 days ago,Full-time,,,2022-12-11 00:25:18.764659,ui ux designer,Glasgow,

I am working with one of London’s top design agencies and they are looking for a freelance Senior UX/ UI Designer (mostly UI Design).

They are looking for disruptive and powerful design, as its to design this agency’s own website, so think minimal, bold, colour, that kind of start-up vibe design. Imagine Monzo style of design (though this isn’t a corporate piece of work)

Here are the awesome things they are looking for:
• Experience with contemporary responsive web design
• Experience with emerging HTML5 animation and interactivity trends
• Ability to design striking responsive web pages with a narrative-to-scroll core
• Ability to design in a way that ensure easy back-end content updating (i.e. WP)
• Ability to design in a way that provides a smooth transition to dev (ie. using Figma)
• Understanding of SEO/social optimised design standards
• Understanding of A/AA optimised design standards
• Understanding of appropriate content treatment

The even... better news is that this is Outside IR35 and fully remote! Dream combo : )

If this is sounding just like you, drop me a note and let’s see where it takes us!

Reporting to the Experience Design Director

Hello! We're Hi Mum! Said Dad.

We're one of the UK's most awarded and innovative digital product studios with a ten-year pedigree in innovation and digital product design. We design for real needs and build digital products that people truly value. In the Strategy and Design team, we're at the product front-line - crafting digital products for mobile, web, voice, and exciting emerging technologies.

We believe creating innovative digital experiences is both a science and an art, so we champion rigorous research and testing as well as giving the Strategy and Design team the space to follow a flexible creative process.

We’re a close-knit team that believe learning from each other is essential to our personal growth. We have dedicated time every week devoted to developing each other’s skills and critiquing each other’s work - even if we’re not on the same project.

As a Senior UX/UI Designer in the Strategy and Design... team, you’ll be involved in every step of the way of creating new digital products from scratch; from research, product strategy, UX design, UI design, and user testing, to collaborating with developers through build and launch.

In return, you’ll get the opportunity to grow your craft and leadership skills, taking on responsibility that stretches you in a way that matches your career aspirations.

Who we’re looking for

We’re looking for someone who has played a role in creating a range of new digital products and is passionate to grow their skillset.

You’ll have a strategic, solution-focused mindset with the ability to translate concepts and ideas into practical and tactical outcomes. You’ll play an integral part of a team that will deliver world-class digital products and experiences for our globally recognised clients.

Your main strength lies in UX design. However, you are also competent at UI design when needed. You’ll have a basic understanding of research, strategy, visual design, and service design.

We have a need for a part-time contractor who can work remotely anywhere in Canada, the US, the UK or Europe. This is an ongoing need and could develop into a permanent part-time contract or staff position.

Who we are: Chelo is the latest AI Tech startup to come out of Post Urban Ventures, a highly successful deep tech AI venture builder. We are a team of serial entrepreneurs with PhDs from Cambridge, MIT, and UCL that is, fully funded, and on a mission to transform the way companies operate, grow, implement their vision, create cultures and products. You can learn more about us here: https://posturban.vc/

What we are working on: We operate in the deep tech AI space, where we focus on applying fundamental science to business problems as we create solutions. As such, we are often developing prototypes to prove our fundamental science hypotheses and we need help creating product on top of these scientific prove outs. For Chelo, we are focusing on the application of graph... structures and AI to knowledge base creation.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced Senior UX Designer to lead the research activities that will help define and drive the future of our products. You’ll be working on a fast-paced, entrepreneurial team in order to discover, explore, and validate Chelo's business propositions as we grow the product. Any experience with: database visualization, graph databases or large qualitative data knowledge bases would be helpful in this role

What we are looking for: In this role here are the key competencies we are looking for.
• Creative: You will help define the problem—not just help influence the solution. You will come up with practical ways to formulate research and design questions, explore problem spaces, and surface insights before having all the information.
• Quick. You can scale—up and down—your research activities to reflect the need: not everything needs to be completely understood or take weeks to deliver value. You look for opportunities to leverage other learning's and insights, even if they aren’t a perfect fit.
• Unconventional. We work on complex challenges that invite bold and unorthodox approaches. You’re not afraid to suggest something that sounds odd or risky, and you build on the ideas of others.
• Comfortable with iterative change. We often need to quickly change direction based on what we’ve learned—or still need to learn. We can be working on more than one idea at a time, ideas can move forward, or ideas can be shelved.
• Embracing ambiguity. We deal with challenges that no one else has tackled yet. We make decisions based on the data we have, knowing there are areas of the problem space we just don’t know much about yet.

Permanent

I'm currently partnered with a web and software development agency based in Crewe who are looking for a Creative Designer to join their team.

The Role
You will design the UI/UX on a variety of digital solutions for our clients including brochure websites, e-commerce platforms, online portals, and software applications. You will take ownership of the entire design process, from helping to collect insights from the client, to designing the UI/UX, reviewing concepts with the client, and handing over to the front-end development team. There may also be opportunity to work on several branding and print design projects (subject to experience).

More specifically, you will:
• Gather insights from the client and develop a thorough understanding of their business (market position, products/services), and users (demographics, psychographics, behavioural) to inform design decisions.
• Design UI/UX concepts for entire systems - driven by insights.
• Present... concepts to clients via screenshare calls, discuss the concepts, and provide rationale behind key design decisions.
• Design responsive views for concepts.
• Iterate design concepts until we reach final concept, working in a collaborative way with project stakeholders throughout the Design phase.
• Liaise with the Technical Lead to ensure that design concepts meet client briefs and functional requirements.
• Hand over designs to the front-end development team for front-end implementation and provide guidance to front-end developers when required.
• Provide updates to Project Support on the progress of Design concepts, identify and communicate any potential blockers.
• Proactively engage with the latest trends in Design and share ideas with the Head of Design.

You
• You will have experience in creating brilliant conceptual web design.
• On a personal level, a creative mind is key, and you must possess a perfectionist approach to detail. A calm and collected character is important as this is a fast-paced environment with several ongoing projects, all of which are time-sensitive.
• Finally, communication skills are critical as you will be working closely with several stakeholders (internal and external). A key component of this role is to effectively gather design requirements from clients, and present your concepts accordingly (via screenshare or face-to-face).
• Ideally, you will have experience as a UX/UI Designer in a similar role, preferably within an agency.

420,3,Senior UX Designer,cinch,Anywhere,via AngelList,"cinch is transforming the UK’s car buying experience. We’re taking one of the last industries to go digital and disrupting it with trailblazing tech and beautifully-simple customer experiences. Now as we accelerate from start-up to scale-up, we’re hiring talented, ambitious and passionate people to join us and drive our success.

Why join cinch? We’re dedicated to building and being a great technology business. Together, we’re creating a supportive, non-bureaucratic culture that is every bit as faff-free as our online customer experience, where communication is open, decisions are made quickly, and everybody has the freedom to bring in new ideas. Of course, working together doesn’t mean we’re in the same room every day. Our teams spend around 60% of their time working remotely – and that’s not going to change.
• The role *

Our business is built around good UX – but we give our UX team the autonomy and opportunity to get involved in the full lifecycle from user research through to... design. After all, making car buying faff-free depends on us creating simple, intuitive user-centric experiences. You’ll use a variety of methods and techniques to really get to know our target audience – their needs, their intentions, their dreams – and keep them front-of-mind throughout the design process. We’re not keen on ‘departments’ here – we work closely with people from different disciplines, sharing our specialist knowledge, exploring new ideas and collaborating to create best-in-class online experiences.

This is a challenging role - we’re taking a 100-year-old industry online for the first time. There are no right answers and no set processes to follow. You’ll need to think on your feet, stay creative and be open to trying, failing, and trying again. We are.
• The person *

Good UX is crucial at cinch. You’ll need a creative and innovative approach to iterative design, as well as a good understanding of lean principles. Sketching, wireframing, prototyping and UI design will all come naturally, as will the ability to present to and communicate with the wider team and senior stakeholders. You’ll need to be resilient, agile and confident enough to try new things and share big ideas.

We’re big on continuous learning, and we build Communities of Practice where our multi-talented teams can share ideas, kick the tyres on new technology and think differently. We’re moving fast, experimenting, learning and reinventing as we go. Can you keep up?

Salary and benefits: Our remuneration package includes a competitive salary and above-law benefits, including 32 paid days off per year (*plus your birthday!) and a great company pension. And of course, bean-to-cup coffee and a stocked kitchen will keep you fuelled while you work side-by-side with other talented, committed, enthusiastic members of a growing team.

Attitude

The ideal person in this role will match the values of our existing team; smart and quick to use your initiative, with a lot of drive, a natural love of development and good-natured when working in a team.

You’ll be happy to share your opinions and experience, suggest solutions to challenges and support others. You’ll be keen to learn new methods and tools; develop your skills and master your craft in a supportive environment. You’ll be happy to work hard in a team, determined to do the best you can to make sure the project journey is enjoyable for everyone involved

Environment

The studio is based in the town centre of Shrewsbury, one of the finest market towns in England. Lockdown has proven how well we work remotely, and so we're open to applications from those who would prefer to work remotely, as well as those who love the energy of working with a team in an open-plan office.

We provide an open, friendly and collaborative working environment, where teammates solve challenges together, share knowledge, and present to each other on emerging trends in technology, software engineering and self-development.

Culture

Dress: We dress how we like in the studio - it’s important that we all feel comfortable while we work - and only brush up for meetings and if we have a client visiting.

Flexibility: Outside of lockdowns, we work together as a team in the studio most days. We’ve learnt to be flexible over lockdown, so don’t mind if you want to work from home occasionally.

Location: We’re a 5-minute walk from the centre of Shrewsbury, just across the river, by the Theatre and right next to Frankwell car park, which means you’ll always find it easy to get into work. A couple of our team members cycle, and there are also bike racks in the studio.

Remote working for this role is also an option. Ideally, you'd live close enough to join the studio for the odd team event, but it's not essential, as long as you're in our timezone so you can work in sync with the rest of the team.

Our values

Our success starts and ends with our team. We aim to inspire our people and provide a connection to how what we do has a larger impact on our clients, their teams, and their communities.

We’re a growing, supportive and collaborative team, working together to build exciting and innovative projects. The great thing about joining a company like us is that there are lots of opportunities to learn, and directions for your career to grow, which will depend on your interests, where you excel and what you aspire to be.

Our core values guide and influence everything we do:
• Comradery - We are in it together and have the good of the company, our clients and the wider community at heart;
• Mastery - We aim to reach the highest standards, personally and professionally and share knowledge to create an environment of learning and growth;
• Adventure - We push outside of our comfort zone with curiosity, explore what’s possible and enjoy the ride;
• All-in - We are confident in the decisions we make, and committed to seeing through projects to a successful outcome.

• Work with the UX designer to further develop wireframes, storyboards, user flows, process flow and site maps where necessary.
• Work with the sales team to create high quality screen concepts that demonstrate to prospective clients initial ideas, how their brand can come to life within the context of the brief, and the calibre of Design at Apadmi.
• Design interactive prototypes that effectively explore and communicate process, interaction and design concepts.

• A brilliant portfolio of UI designs, impactful and effective and with a significant number of mobile examples
• A passion for technology.
• Good knowledge of current official UI guidelines for mobile platforms.
• Expert in UI design software such as Figma and a good working knowledge of the primary Adobe apps (i.e. Photoshop, Illustrator and (to a lesser extent) After Effects).

• Experience of Scrum, SAFE, or other Agile principles.
• Good presentation skills
• Strong creative, organisational, problem solving and time-management skills.
• Must have been in client-facing roles and have project experience in working with teams on different projects.

Why work for Apadmi

Remote First - Manchester (WeWork base)

Paying around £50,000

Would you like to join one of Manchester's latest innovative start ups?

This is a chance to join a start up who have just been injected with cash in order to help develop and continue to grow an already successful product.

You will join a team of 7 which is a mix of experienced engineers including a highly successful CTO who is the brainchild of the product.

Whilst they now have over 75 customers using the product, including some of Manchester's best venues, they see room to grow even further.

Now they have a working model they would like to refine the product in order to make it more user friendly and consistently high performing.

This is why they need to hire their first UX Designer to work closely with the development teams to help improve to work end to end and have a real impact on the user experience.

The benefits structure is still being developed but one thing this organisation can... offer is flexibility and work life balance in abundance.

Sounds like it could be a good fit?

447,0,Senior UX Designer,Auto Trader,"Manchester, UK",via Adzuna,"About the Role:

We’re on a mission to make buying and selling cars an easy and straightforward process. As a Senior UX Designer, you will be key to enabling this for the thousands of retailers that use our applications and sites each month. Working day-to-day with developers, user researchers and product managers you will be involved in every aspect of the product development process, from discovery through to delivery.

Your role will involve taking responsibility for product design within a cross-functional team, continuously improving our experiences and building continuity across web and mobile apps.

You’ll be working with product managers, engineers, and researchers to guide our products through both discovery and iterative delivery tracks, contributing strongly to the full lifecycle of design. This would include running and participating in design workshops and sprints as well as designing, prototyping and testing ideas with your team and in more formal testing... environments.

Working alongside the rest of your team you’ll be playing a key part of decision making throughout the product lifecycle: articulating when and where design thinking and design craft are needed and communicating the value of each. You’ll also play a key role in influencing, persuading, and evangelising our design system and user experience design within your product team and the wider design team.

We are a very data-driven company at heart, so while working at pace you’ll have the confidence to make decisions, knowing when to use qualitative or quantitative data and when it’s acceptable to rely on your knowledge and experience. Our work requires us to be flexible so you’ll be able to switch from high level, big picture thinking to the detail of user stories and UI designs.

Our collaborative approach is key to our success, so as part of the broader design team you’ll be learning from and helping others, identifying and implementing improvements to the way we work. We’d want you to give and welcome feedback and critique from other team members and designers to help encourage personal and professional growth. As a Senior Designer, you’ll also help coach and mentor more junior designers or colleagues in other roles.

What We're Looking For:

Experience with end-to-end UX/product design in a commercial environment - including scoping, researching, prototyping and testing.
Experience in designing digital products for a B2B audience.
Comfortable working closely with developers & testers to bring products to life.
Experience with user testing/research and using data to define outcomes and measure improvements.
Experience in interaction design work, sketches, storyboards, prototypes, and visual design. We would be interested in seeing examples of these in your portfolio.
Appreciation of front-end development technologies.
Good communication & influencing skills, and the ability to synthesise different perspectives.
Although not a requirement, useful experience includes:

Experience of working with design systems.
In house/client-side experience.

Benefits and more:

We offer a competitive salary plus private healthcare, 28 days holiday, plus half-day office closures on both Christmas and New Year's Eve, pension and lots of extras that you can personalise to suit your lifestyle.

Our hybrid working model, Connected Working, gives you various options, including combining office with home working and flexible start and finish times.

To help you get the best out of the working week, we’ve split it into fixed, flex and focus days. Everybody has two fixed office days with their team, a flex day where you decide the day you come in, and two focus days which can be spent at home or in the office.

This role presents a unique opportunity to not only be hands-on with product development, but to establish a customer-centric design culture at a fast-growing startup in the early stages of growth.

How will we measure success in this role?

To be successful in this role, you will need to have a deep understanding of user-centered design principles and methodologies, as well as experience with industry-standard design tools and software. You should also have excellent communication and leadership skills, and be able to work collaboratively in a fast-paced, agile environment.

In your first 12 months we will be looking for you to deliver a great user experience with elegant design solutions within your product area, create a beautiful and flexible design system and level up our existing design capability.

How do you know if you are the right candidate?

Encord is a London-based startup building a comprehensive training data solution for computer vision AI applications. We are backed by CRV, Y Combinator Continuity, the Harvard Management Company, top industry executives, and other leading Bay Area investors.

Started by ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt firsthand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building practical AI. AI feels to us like what the early days of computing or the internet must have felt like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are terrible. We have devised a unique methodology for automating the tasks related to preparing quality training data, in effect turning the training data problem into a data science problem.

The Role

We are looking for an experienced UI/UX design engineer to help us build, design, and ship delightful and innovative products and features for modelling... creating, and managing training data for building AI applications. You will be collaborating closely with our customers to understand how they interact with our web-based UI’s, and how we can make them more intuitive and look prettier.

Our ideal UI/UX designer has taken part in designing technical B2B/Enterprise SaaS products from ideating using wireframes and all the way to production. Needless to say, the right candidate is passionate about beautiful product UX and design.

Qualifications

The right candidate will have proven experience working with web frontend development and design, with any of the following is a plus:

• Rapid prototyping of user interfaces using commonly used tools such as Figma, Photoshop, or similar

• A good understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion

• Experience building public facing websites that work elegantly across commonly used browsers

• Advanced knowledge of modern HTML and CSS

What We Offer

Encord offers a unique opportunity to be part of a startup with a clear mission and vision. You will get to explore and build services enterprise AI use cases across many different industry verticals such as healthcare, surveillance, retail, and agriculture.

Our work is at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning, which also includes working on solving unsolved problems within those fields.

Autonomy: we believe in hiring great people, then giving them the space and flexibility to work in the way that's best for them. We will agree on goals, and then expect you to decide how you want to pursue those goals.

Collaboration: as a fast growing small business we all work together across multiple workstreams. We have a flat structure and encourage frank discussion, honesty and openness.

Learning and development: the blockchain space is developing at an incredibly fast rate. Having a growth mentality and being open to continuous learning is an important part of our culture. It's always OK to not know the answer to something and have to do some research! We cement this by offering more formal perks to help fund employees' continued education.

Diversity and Inclusion: inclusiveness is one of our blockchain's core strengths, and in the same way we are committed to inclusiveness across all diversity dimensions. We are also actively looking for talent outside of the immediate blockchain space. What we primarily look for is general markers of excellence and ambition.

Mission driven: we believe that the Tezos blockchain is going to change the world and our goal is to promote its adoption. Blockchain technology will power new positive change, increase the democratisation of previously restricted systems and create transparency and trust",,"['7 days ago', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",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,7 days ago,Full-time,,,2022-12-11 00:18:38.936093,ui ux designer,London,

We have fun doing what we do and that’s one of the many reasons we’re one of the best places to work in the UK games business (Gameindustry 2021 Large studio category).

If you want a positive work/life balance, we’re right behind you. While we live to create extraordinary games, we know that’s not all you’ve got going on, so you can trust that we always keep things in perspective, fostering an environment where work can be more than just a job.

Our flexible working culture gives team members the responsibility to optimise their workloads, with in-office, hybrid, and remote working options.

They are looking for disruptive and powerful design, as its to design this agency’s own website, so think minimal, bold, colour, that kind of start-up vibe design. Imagine Monzo style of design (though this isn’t a corporate piece of work)

Here are the awesome things they are looking for:

· Experience with contemporary responsive web design

· Experience with emerging HTML5 animation and interactivity trends

· Ability to design striking responsive web pages with a narrative-to-scroll core

· Ability to design in a way that ensure easy back-end content updating (i.e. WP)

· Understanding of SEO/social optimised design standards

· Understanding of A/AA optimised design standards

· Understanding of appropriate content treatment

The... even better news is that this is Outside IR35 and fully remote! Dream combo : )

I am working with one of London's top design agencies and they are looking for a freelance Senior UX/ UI Designer (mostly UI Design).

They are looking for disruptive and powerful design, as its to design this agency's own website, so think minimal, bold, colour, that kind of start-up vibe design. Imagine Monzo style of design (though this isn't a corporate piece of work)

Here are the awesome things they are looking for:

·Experience with contemporary responsive web design
·Experience with emerging HTML5 animation and interactivity trends
·Ability to design striking responsive web pages with a narrative-to-scroll core
·Ability to design in a way that ensure easy back-end content updating (i.e. WP)
·Ability to design in a way that provides a smooth transition to dev (ie. using Figma)
·Understanding of SEO/social optimised design standards
·Understanding of A/AA optimised design standards
·Understanding of appropriate content treatment

The even better news... is that this is Outside IR35 and fully remote! Dream combo : )

Our flexible working culture gives team members the responsibility to optimise their workloads, with in-office, hybrid, and remote working options.

527,0,Senior UI/UX Designer,Builder.ai - What would you Build?,"London, UK",via Jobs By Workable,"About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build... run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

We have evolved as a product organisation over the last five years, with UX and UI design being done locally within product teams. We're now at a scale where we are ready for greater leadership across our design approach, to build a more coherent customer experience. We're looking for someone to take on this leadership role and step up the maturity of our UX/UI design model.

In this newly created role, as our Lead UX/UI Designer you'll relish the opportunity to write the rulebook on how we design at IAGL – specifically building our design system from the ground up. You'll enjoy the challenge of designing across four established airline brands, whilst bringing to life a unifying identity for loyalty that is relevant, inspiring and rewarding. You'll have the vision and influence to lead across multiple product teams in a... matrix organisation to achieve our design goals, working confidently with both contract and permanent design colleagues.

You'll enjoy the challenge of shaping this new role and playing a leadership role in the next phase of our growth. You'll have the opportunity to work across our wide-ranging product set, covering leading-edge technologies and touching partners in the airline, travel, finance and retail sectors.

How will I add value in this role?

You'll get under the skin of our user experience design today, identifying the assets, tools and ways of working in play, and how they ultimately come together to create our user experience. You'll set a strategy for world-class UX/UI design and provide the leadership to get us there.

You'll create IAG Loyalty's visual language by building a design system for use across cross-functional product teams, developing and designing products for our partner airlines (British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling). You'll drive adoption of the design system across our design and product community, working with teams to ensure a clear set of design standards are being met whilst actively utilising the input of our teams to continuously improve the system.

You'll always see the bigger picture and help build a holistic view of all the customer touchpoints, setting a strong foundation to build coherent and delightful customer experiences on. You'll also bring a fresh pair of eyes to the role, spotting opportunities to improve the way UX design is done at IAG Loyalty.

You'll act as a leader, coaching and supporting designers with design system adoption and ways of working. You'll implement best practices to bring our design community across IAGL together, as well as translating your design vision for audiences across the organisation.

You'll enjoy the visibility you'll have at all levels of our organisation, providing a ‘consulting' style approach to the way to you influence, shape and challenge our thinking.

What experience would you like me to have?

You'll be a senior UX/UI designer with experience across web and app channels, and with a range of design tools including Figma.

You'll have a strong track record in developing design systems that power brilliant and inclusive customer experiences. You'll be well versed in the design landscape with an understanding of how the best organisations are approaching design today.

You'll have the ability to embed yourself across the Product organisation and become the go-to for UX/UI leadership. Your communication skills will extend to both design and non-design audiences, to ensure the importance and strategy for design is understood by all. Your ability to manage stakeholders will be key to your success. You're able to influence without having direct control.

You'll have experience setting and leading UX/UI strategy and have the desire to go beyond the ‘doing' and into a functional leadership role.

Everything we build from a game design perspective you get your hands on; from systems to mechanics, from the HUD and menus to control schemes, from usability testing to player advocacy, you make sure that at all times, the player experience is at the forefront of your mind, and on the minds of the Directors, Leads, and Implementers responsible for putting our game together. We can’t create a great game without you.

As the Lead UX Designer, you’re the glue-master. In addition to working with the Game Director to set the overall vision and direction for user experience, you are a master communicator; capable of ensuring that UX design is on the same page not only with each other, but with the UI artists and other team members that both rely upon and request help from... the UX team.

What You Will Do:
• Lead a team of UX and UI professionals to hit the shared vision for the video game
• Collaborate with Leads and Directors to define the overall vision, design and interface of next gen titles
• Create documentation to communicate the vision, including but not limited to wireframes and flowcharts
• Understand what our players are doing and get to the bottom of why they’re doing what they do
• Take complex game mechanics and use your knowledge of good interaction design to produce creative and effective UX solutions
• Create working prototypes that demonstrate the design and reduce risk in the production phase of development
• Take an iterative approach to development by working closely with the rest of the development team to improve the end user’s understanding of how to interact with the UI and improve the overall user experience
• Champion the design department’s UX related work, guiding future approaches to UX
• Ensure an overall high-quality level of UX design and User Experience
• Collaborate actively with teams across the globe
• Coordinate with external groups both within and outside of 2K to put together usability testing that gives you the data you need to validate your decisions

Who We Think Will Be A Good Fit:
• Experience in leading teams through all stages of UX development
• Experience in cross site communication of design, presentations and progress reporting
• Excellent communication skills - must be ready to work with teams across the globe
• Shipped at least one AAA console project
• Understanding and experience of in-game stores and monetisation UX desirable
• Understanding and experience of in-game stores and monetisation UX desirable
• Highly skilled in Wireframe Creation Software, Adobe Suite, primarily Photoshop, After Effects (Trapcode), Animate, or other tools that help you put together strong prototypes
• Love for our players, and a dedication to usability testing and practices
• Passion for games
• Strong ability to digest complex and critical feedback and channel it into strong visual designs
• Strong sense of aesthetics and how to communicate visually
• Comfort in working with technical toolsets
• Must be able to work well under pressure
• Self-motivate
• Humble at all times, not driven by personal ego

• Experience managing a small team through all phases of the project lifecycle
• Portfolio showing experience designing high fidelity UI using industry standard tools, e.g., Adobe XD, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, etc

We work diligently to present the available information about elections, candidates, judges, ballot measures, policies, and more in a way that enables our readers to vote with confidence and to act as engaged citizens outside of the polling booth.

Ballotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people.

When we launched in 2007, we did not go out of our way to seek new readers. Starting with our small team of visionary idealists, nerds, and aspiring political journalists, we just wrote the best unbiased online articles we could, especially about ballot measures.

Readers found those articles in droves. It turns out there was an unclaimed audience out there people who wanted straightforward facts about political issues, and were willing to read at length instead of just scanning the headlines.

If you build it, they will come : '' our readers came to our neutral oasis in growing numbers; we’ve had many millions of lifetime pageviews, we reached nearly half of all voters in 2020, and, in the month surrounding the November 2020 election, we were the 77th most-visited website in the U.S.

We’ve come to realize that we need to meet our readers where they are. In doing so, over the past five years, we’ve grown our email newsletter program from infancy to include more than 1,000,000 opt-in subscribers with more than a dozen newsletters to choose from.

We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it, including on mobile phones while you’re standing in the voting booth.

We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential to the preservation of our great civilization in a world where too many others are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational posts and the irrational decisions they foster.

721,9,Senior UI/UX Designer,Databento,Anywhere,via Talentify,"The financial industry is growing at a record pace, but our data providers are still stuck in the past — with cumbersome onboarding processes, complicated APIs, slow infrastructure, and expensive licensing costs.

Databento is the next-generation market data provider — with the radical idea that you should only pay for the data that you use. We power the world's largest finance and fintech... institutions and lower the barrier of entry for small startups.

Since starting in 2019, we've raised over $27.8M in funding and have over 2,000 companies signed up pre-launch. Our team consists of former data users from firms like Two Sigma, Belvedere, Pico, Bloomberg, Pinterest, and Google.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency.
Responsibilities

As a Senior UI/UX Designer, you'll be working closely with our product and engineering teams to design and improve on our core product and implement growth strategies to widen our user base. You'll be:
• Designing and improving everything from end-to-end user flows to visual optimizations for specific features.
• Implementing both high-fidelity prototypes and low-fidelity wireframes.
• Working with engineers to bridge the gap between design and technical implementation.
• Working with external and internal (CEO, CTO, community team) stakeholders to identify and prioritize user needs.
• Conducting user testing and assimilating customer feedback.
• Planning and conducting user research and interviews.
• Motivating design-oriented decisions and standards firm-wide.
The product

Our core products are an API service and an enterprise web application. Here are some key highlights of our product strategy:
• Product-led growth with low touch sales. We rely on product features like referrals, team invites and self-signup process instead of a traditional sales pipeline to scale our user base.
• Enterprise-grade, consumer-scale product. (Like Slack or GitHub.) Our competitors adopt a traditional enterprise SaaS strategy, opting to hide their product behind a ""request for quote/demo"" and employing a high touch onboarding process with big sales teams. We believe we can outpace their growth by targeting the same enterprises with an institutional-grade product that instead has the ease of adoption and transparency of a consumer product.
• Targeting a developer-centric user base. (Like AWS, Stripe or Plaid.) We pursue the exponential effect of providing products that enable developers to build an ecosystem of other products and tools.
• Fast iteration. With multiple deployments per day.
• Putting product needs before technical limitations. We have great engineers who will walk over hot coals to actualize difficult product requirements.
What makes being a UI/UX designer at Databento exciting
• You'll impact high-level product decisions as well as shape product design culture. As one of our initial design hires, you will largely influence the product design culture and help set the stage for our product's growth. As such, we value designers who take initiative and can design with ambiguity, and can contribute feedback on how to improve our design processes.
• We're focused on product-led growth, not sales-led growth. We resonate with the pain that design is less prioritized in many enterprise products. At Databento, our product is the central driver of growth, and you'll be at the center of developing our product experience. Not only are our founders always raising the bar of our product's design quality, but our engineers, who usually fall into target user profile, contribute to advocating for and improving user experience.
• You'll receive timely compensation rewards that reflect your impact Here, we believe in giving kudos when it's due. We measure your value based on your work and direct contributions you put in, and reward frequently and accordingly when it comes to pay and promotions. Additionally, we offer competitive base pay that is comparable to other top tech companies.
Requirements
• 5+ years of experience as a UI/UX Designer or Product Designer.
• Proficiency with design tools (Figma, Adobe).
• Experience collaborating with engineers and other designers.
• Experience performing user research, user flow mapping and presenting options to stakeholders.
• Understanding of color theory, typography, interaction design, motion principles and visual hierarchy.
• Keen eye for design improvements and visual detail.
• A strong portfolio.
• Bachelor's degree in a design or technical field, such as HCI, Design or Information Architecture.
Bonus qualifications
• Experience with designing enterprise web applications or API products (e.g. Stripe, Twilio, Plaid, Segment, Algolia, Agora).
• Industry knowledge in fintech.
• Familiarity with responsive design.
• Familiarity with collecting user metrics and analyzing user sessions (e.g. Amplitude, Heap, Mixpanel).
• Experience with front-end web development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript).
• Exposure to product management at high growth startup.

Let’s face it. You’ve always dreamed of working with a start-up from the ground up where your brilliant design ideas could be applied to a wicked cool new product. We’re talking about a product that will not only revolutionize an industry, but more importantly for your sake, one that you and your friends will use, and one that you’ll be happy to brag about. Sound intriguing?

If you think you’ve got enough spunk and also possess some mad skills, keep reading.

We’re looking to bring on a talented UI/UX web designer with excellent HTML and CSS skills to join our dynamic team. The right individual will have experience designing User Interfaces for web and mobile applications, will have good typographical skills, a strong foundation in design principles, semantic markup, web standards. We’ll be looking for a solid and passionate designer who will enjoy leading the user experience efforts from interaction, usability, and graphic design all the way to HTML and CSS. They’ll also be focused on continuous UI improvement based on evolving requirements and customer feedback.

Within the context of a team, the designer will have prime responsibility for making sure the product being built provides an awesome user experience. This means communicating with the product manager, developers, and any other stakeholders to address concerns and then find solutions. While we stress the importance of functionality and usability, we still expect a high level of visual refinement to our products. An excellent understanding and use of grids, typography, color, etc. are essential for building quality, compelling products.

The UI designer creates prototypes and wireframes, works closely with project teams and product management, documents the design in technical specs, and creates UI code (HTML, CSS) that can be utilized by the development team. The UI designer will also ensure that the design is consistent throughout. Staying up to date with the latest UI technologies is second nature to the right candidate and they’ll also inherently possess the creativity to conceive new breakthrough UI approaches. Jetsonify is currently operating in “stealth mode” for the time being, but feel free to get in touch for more info if you think that you’re the rock star that we’re looking for.

Ideally we’d love for someone to join our team full time in Cambridge/Boston, MA. But seeing as how life is rarely ideal, we’d also be open to talking to designers in San Fran or Atlanta. If you’re reading this and you’re outside of these areas but still think you deserve a shot at the title, we’ll entertain your plea for working virtually if you make an impressive case for us to consider, in 3 sentences or less.

Duties/Responsibilities

• Design the User Interfaces for complex software applications for the web, desktop and mobile applications.
• Participate and lead design reviews.
• Develop detailed design specifications based on functional requirements and the created prototypes.
• Work with engineers and product manager to ensure the product is being developed as per the design specifications.
• Educate the organization in UI best practices and new technologies.
• Work with teams on early prototypes that help gather ideas and shape future product enhancements.

Required Skills/Education

• 3-5 years experience in UI design, user interaction, and/or UX design
• Highly skilled in HTML, CSS
• Expertise in usability

Functionally, you will be in charge of all of our User Experience and Interface design work - user testing and feedback, creating user journeys, synthesizing collaboration with marking, engineering, product to execute on the experience and interface components of the product vision, and creating assets (or managing a visual designer to do so). There will be an opportunity to build out a full design team as we continue to expand.

We are looking for someone with...
• Proven track record successfully taking a product design from concept to successful execuction with demonstrable results on business goals
• Is experienced at collecting user feedback and sees this as a necessary part of the UI/UX process
• Communicates openly and transparently
• Thrives in a collaborative environment and can work independently to execute
• Wants to own their work product and lead Depict's UI/UX design vision and execution
• Is data-driven and action-oriented (knows how to balance data and intuition in decision-making)
• Meets commitments and self-imposed deadlines (gets it done)
• Is incredibly organized with attention to the smallest details
• Bonus points if you can code (html, css, javascript, jQuery)

More About Depict

Depict is a new medium for visual experiences. The Depict ecosystem delivers incredibly stunning and visceral art experiences by enabling people to access and display an entirely new art medium in their own spaces. The work is exclusive to Depict, curated by our in-house curatorial team and previously unavailable elsewhere.

Depict protects the artwork with technology that enables scarcity and provenance tracking, so it is something customers can invest in and re-sell down the road. To display the work, Depict created its own device, a stunning 50” museum quality ultra-high definition display purpose built for delivering incredible visual experiences in interior spaces.

Why digital art: A convergence of social and technological trends has created ideal conditions for the digital art economy to thrive. In the meantime, the quality of modern 4k displays, and the potential for lightweight, flexible screens means that digital art can look beautiful in homes and businesses everywhere.
